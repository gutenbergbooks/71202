INTRODUCTION
</p>

<p>
If you are the sort of a boy who is afraid
of becoming dissatisfied with his present
outlook on life and vision of possibilities
for the future, you had better not read this
book.
</p>

<p>
In fact, there are just two classes of boys
who should be permitted to read these
fascinating pages.
</p>

<p>
The ambitious boys are in one class; those
who are determined to make their lives count.
That type of boy will be helped toward finding
the best outlet for his services.  He will learn
of fields of investment for his life work which
have brought rich returns to other boys.  His
vision will be broadened, his objective made
higher.
</p>

<p>
The other class of boy who should read
this book is that in whom the fires of
ambition have not yet been kindled; he who
is living on the dead level of life, just
"groping to and fro".  This type of boy will
be inspired to tackle the climbing life when he
learns of the handicaps which other boys have
overcome and of the great goals they have won.
The following lines from the story of Edward
Bok, the little Dutch boy, is descriptive
of general conditions: "When he got out into
the world, he was astonished to find how many
of his young friends believed that the only
way to get on was through favouritism.  That
was not his experience.  He found that if a
young man were willing to work and do his
very best, the way to success was wide and it
was not overpeopled.  He was astonished to
find how many young men there were who were
not doing their best or anything like it.  He
did all that was expected of him and a little
more."
</p>

<p>
As boys, we resent "being nagged at".  We
rebel, and our souls shrivel up when Dad,
Mother, Teacher or some interested friend
starts to point out our weaknesses.  On the
other hand, how it stirs our blood and thrills
us as we read of some fellow who has played
the game of life against fearful odds and has
come through with a crowning achievement!
</p>

<p>
Some one has said, "He can who thinks he
can." No boy can read these "Stories of
Grit" without believing more firmly in his
ability to succeed.
</p>

<p>
When the grind comes and we are ready to
give up the struggle, the inspiration from
these "boys who overcame" will send us both
to our little difficulties with an enthusiasm
which knows no defeat.
</p>

<p>
I have talked with boys who have said
"Latin has me licked", and they were ready
to throw over the possibilities of a college
course and a chosen profession because of the
Latin in the Matriculation Examination.  Give
any boy one hour with these "Stories of Grit",
and I guarantee that it will stiffen his backbone
and give him a punch so effective that he
will be able to "lick his weight in wildcats".

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE BLIND BOY WHO BECAME POET, PREACHER AND AUTHOR.
</h3>

<p>
George Matheson was born in
Glasgow, Scotland, on March 27th,
1842.  When he was only eighteen
months old his mother made the melancholy
discovery that his eyesight was defective.  He
had inflammation at the back of the eyes.
Several specialists were consulted, but little hope
was held out to the boy's parents.
</p>

<p>
The failure of his eyesight was gradual.
For several years he could see fairly well.
During the greater part of his school-life he
could read and write by using powerful
eye-glasses and large type.  He was permitted to
sit near the window so that he might get the
full benefit of the sunlight.  In spite of the
serious difficulties which faced him during
those years, George Matheson took high
standing in his class.  He managed to learn French,
German, Latin and Greek, and in some
subjects he led his class.
</p>

<p>
He was ever hoping that his eyesight would
improve.  It was the custom of his family to
spend most of their summer holidays at one
of the seaside resorts on the Firth of Clyde,
and George took great delight in watching
the steamboats as they plied up and down the
river.  It was there that he spent many
anxious hours testing his eyesight.  He would
stand on the pier and watch the boats in the
distance.  He would try to make out how many
funnels each had, and as they drew nearer,
what their names were.  At times he thought
that his eyes were improving; but at last he
had to admit to himself that they were
gradually getting worse.
</p>

<p>
For the greater part of his life he was largely
dependent upon other people.  His lessons
at college were read to him, and, thanks to a
marvellous memory, he learned with amazing
thoroughness.  He had a wonderfully cheerful
disposition.  To become blind when so young
would have been sufficient to crush all brightness
out of most lives, but not so with George
Matheson.  He rose above his terrible
calamity, and showed himself a real hero.
</p>

<p>
When only eleven he was admitted to the
Glasgow Academy.  He took his place alongside
other pupils, studied the same subjects,
and sat for the same examinations.  When it
came to marking his exam. papers no favours
whatever were granted to him, and yet his four
years at the Academy were years of unbroken
distinction.  In his first year he gained the
prize for history and religious knowledge.  In
his second year he gained prizes in Latin,
history, geography and English composition.
In his third and fourth years he won nearly
all the special prizes, and finished with a
wonderfully high record.
</p>

<p>
He matriculated for Glasgow University in
1857, when he was only fifteen.  During his
term there his eyesight became gradually
worse, until by the time he was eighteen he
was practically blind.  When this terrible
handicap is taken into consideration, George
Matheson's record at the university stands as
a wonderful example of perseverance and
pluck.  In all his classes he stood high, and
especially shone in debates and oratorical
contests.  He received his B.A. degree in 1861,
with "honourable distinction in philosophy,"
and his M.A. degree one year later.  In 1862
he entered Divinity Hall to study for the
ministry.  For four years he gave himself to
the most careful preparation for that calling,
and in 1866, after nine years spent in Glasgow
University, he was licensed to preach.
</p>

<p>
In January, 1867, George Matheson became
the assistant minister at St. Bernard's parish
in Glasgow.  He preached regularly to large
congregations, and prepared his sermons with
much care.  When he stood up to preach
people forgot all about his blindness.  He
committed the whole service to memory; hymns,
lessons, and sermons, and such was his
splendid memory, that he never seemed at a
loss for anything to say.  After a year at
St. Bernard's he was appointed minister of
Innellan Church, where he remained for
several years and preached and ministered to a
very large congregation.  Innellan, because of
its beautiful situation and bracing air, had
become a favourite summer resort, and to
these attractions was added George Matheson's
fame as a preacher.  People came from
far and near to hear him, and none ever went
away disappointed.
</p>

<p>
What a picture it is to think of that blind
man, standing there in his pulpit, instructing
and comforting people who had perfect eyesight
and seemed more favoured than he.  Yet
in all his sermons and in his conversation,
there was cheerfulness and gratitude to God.
No one ever heard him murmur or complain,
and when he stood up and offered prayer, or
read the Psalms in his clear, ringing voice,
everyone realized that his whole heart was in
the service.  He became known as "Matheson
of Innellan" and many people went there,
summer after summer, in order to hear him
preach.
</p>

<p>
In 1886 George Matheson was called to
St. Bernard's Church, Edinburgh.  In May of
that year he began his work as minister to that
congregation, and remained for thirteen years.
It was a very large congregation.  There were
nearly fifteen hundred members, in addition
to hundreds of others who were simply
attendants.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Matheson resolved that he would not
only preach to his people, but would visit
them in their homes.  His sister was deeply
attached to him, and accompanied him wherever
he went.  Before he had been six months
at Edinburgh he had visited six hundred
families, besides calling upon the sick, the
aged, the infirm and the dying.  In addition to
all this he was preparing sermons of rare
quality and working in close sympathy with
all the associations of his church.  The visits
he made upon his people were occasions long
to be remembered.  He was so warm-hearted
and full of sympathy, that every person he
met realized that it was no formal visit.
Dr. Matheson kept up this method of visitation
throughout his whole ministry.  His church
grew until there were nearly eighteen hundred
members; yet he made a determined effort to
keep in close touch with them all; and, blind
though he was, he succeeded much better than
most men would have done who had perfect
vision.
</p>

<p>
Like Henry Fawcett, the blind Postmaster-General
of England, Dr. Matheson had a
marvellous memory.  No doubt the loss of
eyesight does much to quicken the faculty of
memory.  Often after he had preached, the
vestry would be besieged with people who
were anxious to speak with him.  Many
of these people had known him before, and it
was a source of amazement to them to have the
blind preacher call them by name almost
immediately after hearing them speak.
Sometimes visitors from a distance, whom he had
not seen for many years, would say, "You'll
not remember me, Doctor."  Perhaps a puzzled
look would cross his face; then he would say,
"yes I do; you are Mackintosh, of &mdash;&mdash;"  It
would be Mackintosh right enough, and
Mackintosh would be a very much surprised man.
</p>

<p>
In addition to his preaching and visiting,
George Matheson was the author of many fine
books.  In 1882 he published a book of
meditations with the title "My Aspirations".
The success of this book was instantaneous,
and in a very short time the entire edition was
sold out, and several other editions followed.
Later he published many other volumes,
among them being: "Moments on the Mount",
"Voices of the Spirit", "Searching in the
Silence", "Times of Refreshing", "Leaves for
Quiet Hours", and "Rests by the River".  His
books proved helpful to thousands of people.
From every part of the world letters came
from people whose lives had been greatly
blessed by reading the works of the blind
author.  What was true of his preaching was
also true of his writing.  People felt, at once,
the strong, cheerful, grateful heart of the
author.  Great numbers of people, around
whose lives heavy clouds had gathered, had
their hearts strengthened, and their faith in
God renewed, as they read George Matheson's books.
</p>

<p>
In 1882 he wrote his famous hymn, now
known the world over, "O Love, that will not
let me go."  It would be impossible to tell just
what this hymn has meant to thousands of
people.  The hymn is now found in most
hymnals and has become a great favourite.
George Matheson gives the following account
of how he came to write it; "The hymn was
composed in the manse of Innellan on the
evening of the sixth of June, 1882.  I was at
that time alone.  It was the day of my sister's
marriage, and the rest of the family were
staying over night in Glasgow.  Something had
happened to me, which was known only to
myself, and which caused me the most severe
mental suffering.  The hymn was the fruit of
that suffering.  It was the quickest bit of work
I ever did in my life.  I had the impression of
having it dictated to me by some inward voice
rather than of working it out myself.  I am
quite sure that the whole work was completed
in five minutes, and equally sure that it never
received at my hands any retouching or correction."
</p>

<p>
George Matheson lived to be sixty-four
years of age and managed to fill every hour
with useful and loving service.  To read an
account of one day's work in the life of this
blind man is sufficient to make most people
realize how hard he worked.  He was methodical
in his habits and careful to leave no duty
undone.  After breakfast each morning he
attended to his correspondence, generally
answering letters by return mail.  Then he
would have read to him the morning papers.
He showed a keen interest in everything that
was going on.  From that he would pass on to
his studies in French and German.  This
would be followed by some study in science,
philosophy, history or theology.  Then he
would dictate to his secretary, something for
the press or for his own use as a speaker.
Added to such work, of course, there were his
extensive labors as pastor and preacher, and it
can be truthfully said that he did not fail in
anything.  Whatever task he put his hand to,
he did with all his might.
</p>

<p>
George Matheson died at North Berwick, on
August 28th, 1906, and was buried at Glasgow
a few days later.  Tributes of sympathy came
to his relatives from all over the world.  By
his strong preaching, and probably still more
by his brave, cheerful spirit as set forth in his
books, he had helped a very great number of
people everywhere.  In his noble hymn he had
written, "I trace the rainbow through the
rain."  That is exactly what he did.  Where
so many others saw only difficulties, he saw
possibilities.  And so it came to pass that,
though he lived in darkness for nearly half a
century, he served God and his fellow-men
with a devotion which will never be forgotten.

CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
HOW A LAME BOY BECAME THE WORLD'S GREATEST POTTER.
</h3>

<p>
In the summer of 1730 a little lad was born
at Burslem in Staffordshire, England.
There was no fear of the little fellow being
lonely for he came into a family where there
were already twelve boys and girls.  Josiah
Wedgewood, for that was the boy's name, was
number thirteen.  Was he unlucky?  Well, in
some ways he was, but in others he was not.
His mother had her hands full with so large
a family, but she taught Josiah to read and
write and then sent him to a dame's school.
Later he was sent to a school in
Newcastle-under-Lyme.  This school was three and a half
miles from where he lived, but the little fellow
was keen to get an education and cheerfully
trudged the seven miles to and from school
each day.  He was a lively boy, fond of all
kinds of sports and a general favourite at
school.  He showed a remarkable faculty for
making paper designs.  With pen and scissors
he cut out designs of an army in combat, a fleet
of ships at sea, a house and gardens, and many
other interesting things.  This gift of Josiah's
gave great pleasure to his little friends, but
the schoolmaster took a very different view
and rather severely admonished the budding
designer.  Josiah was also fond of collecting
fossils, shells and beautiful things which he
found around the country lanes.  He was
constantly bringing these things home, and at
last he fitted up a disused workshop of his
father's and it served the purpose of a
miniature museum.
</p>

<p>
When Josiah was nine years of age his
father died.  It was a great blow to the family,
for while the father had never been more than
an ordinary workingman, he had kept his
family in fairly good circumstances.  Josiah
was taken from school at once and sent to help
in the factory, where his eldest brother,
Thomas, was in charge.  For several
generations the Wedgewoods had been potters and
the whole countryside was famous as the chief
centre of the industry in England.  It was a
proud day for Josiah when first he began to
work at the trade in which he was destined to
become so great.  He was too young to understand
what a serious handicap it is to be sent
out into the world with little education, and
besides, in those days, comparatively few
received a thorough training in school.  Several
of his brothers and sisters never learned to
read or write, and after they became men and
women, they had to sign their names with a
mark, for they had never learned to write even
their own names.
</p>

<p>
When he was eleven a serious misfortune
befell Josiah; one which darkened his whole
life.  The terrible scourge of small-pox swept
over England, as it did over all European
countries from time to time, and he suffered a
severe attack.  In those days medical skill had
not developed very much, and the doctors were
quite unequal to the task of dealing with the
dreadful disease.  Besides that, the utter lack
of sanitation, and the conditions under which
most of the people lived, were such that it
seemed as though plagues must just run their
course.  Severe cases of small-pox were almost
regarded as hopeless, and recovery was very
rare.  For a time it seemed as though Josiah
could not live, but at last he rallied.  His right
knee, however, was seriously affected, and for
the remainder of his life he was a cripple.
</p>

<p>
When only fourteen years of age Josiah was
formally apprenticed to his brother.  He had,
like other apprentices, to sign an agreement
that he would not gamble, frequent taverns, or
indulge in any of the prevailing vices.  Many
boys, of course, signed such agreements
without really intending to live up to their vows,
but Josiah lived up to his pledge.  Throughout
the years of his apprenticeship he devoted
himself with amazing concentration to his
trade.  There was a great deal of drunkenness
and gambling and other vices at that time, but
Josiah's record was beyond reproach.  He
loved his work and gave himself fully to it.
Everything connected with the potter's trade
he found interesting.  He did not know what
dull moments were.
</p>

<p>
Josiah soon showed a desire to do things in
his own way.  He was constantly striving after
new effects and attempting new designs.  Many
of those working with him marvelled at his
wonderful skill, but his brother Thomas did
not like it.  Thomas was making a fair living
by doing the same old things in the same old
way and he did not want any changes
introduced.  It seemed to him that Josiah was
simply wasting his time with his new-fangled
ideas.  When Josiah had served his
apprenticeship he offered to go into partnership
with Thomas, but the elder brother was not
willing, so Josiah had to look elsewhere for
work.
</p>

<p>
For a while he became associated with other
men and he was at liberty to make his
experiments to his heart's content.  But soon
Josiah discovered that his associates were
simply taking advantage of his good nature
and profiting by his skill.  In 1759, when he
was twenty-nine years of age, he started in
business for himself.  His beginning was in a
very humble way, for he had very little money;
but he rejoiced in being his own master, and
resolved to work away at carrying out some of
the ideas he had cherished for so long.
</p>

<p>
About this time he suffered very great pain
from his injured leg.  At times he had to work
away with his leg resting on a stool in front of
him.  On one occasion he injured his leg and
was laid up in bed for several months.
During this period he did a good deal of reading
and tried to make up for his lack of early
training.  He also had time to think out many
new plans for his work, and he solemnly
resolved to become the greatest potter of his
time.  His mother had died some years
previously and his outlook in some ways was not
very bright.  He wrote in his diary: "I have
my trade, a lame leg, the marks of small-pox,
and I never was good-looking anyway."
</p>

<p>
When he was able to get about again he
resumed his work with more enthusiasm than
ever.  Instead of doing as his brother Thomas
and other potters were doing&mdash;simply making
plain butter-crocks, brown jugs and such like,
he spent a great deal of time experimenting in
glazes, in a semi-transparent green color which
he had made for himself.  Soon his wonderfully
artistic designs began to attract attention,
and his reputation extended throughout
England.
</p>

<p>
Up till this time practically all the really
beautiful pottery in England had been
imported from other countries.  Because of the
great distance and of the difficulties of
transportation, this pottery was very expensive.
An aristocratic Burnham family, who possessed
some very fine rare specimens, had the
misfortune to have their largest plate broken.
They sought the assistance of all the leading
potters to help them get a duplicate, but failed.
Then they were directed to Josiah Wedgewood.
He succeeded where others had failed
and to the amazement of all he produced a
perfect facsimile of the broken plate.  The
news of this achievement soon spread and he
received orders for more work than he could
carry out.
</p>

<p>
Some years before this, Josiah had seen
Sarah Wedgewood and had become deeply
attached to her.  Sarah's father and his own
were cousins, but whereas his father had been
a humble workman, Richard Wedgewood was
considered a wealthy man.  By dint of hard
work Josiah saved a hundred pounds, which in
those days was considered quite a sum of
money.  He wrote to Sarah and told her of his
success, and she wrote back and congratulated
him, telling him how proud they were of his
achievements in artistic pottery.  Josiah was
greatly encouraged by this letter, and on the
strength of it he visited her home and asked
her hand in marriage.  Sarah seems to have
been quite willing, but her father was very
angry.  He had taken a friendly interest in his
distant relative, and was glad to know of the
wonderful things he was doing in artistic
pottery, but after all Josiah was still poor, lame,
and disfigured by small-pox.  He had no
intention of allowing his daughter to marry such
a man.  He had some one else in view whom he
considered would be a much better match.
</p>

<p>
It was a very painful experience for the
lame man, but its bitterness was offset by one
thing: Sarah herself hastened to make it clear
to Josiah that she loved him and did not want
to marry any one else.  Encouraged by this he
resolved to work harder than ever.  He wrote
to Sarah telling her that he would yet be the
best potter that England had ever seen.
</p>

<p>
This was no idle boast.  Orders for his work
came so fast that he had to extend his
workshop from time to time and take on more
workmen.  He had often noticed how untidy and
slovenly the men were in the various
workshops and he determined to have things done
differently in his factory.  Some of the men
keenly resented his particular ways, but he
reasoned with them, and showed them the
wisdom of his methods.  Soon the workmen caught
the enthusiasm of their master and fell
heartily in with his plans.
</p>

<p>
He determined that not one bit of poor
pottery should leave his workshop.  Sometimes
he would look very carefully at some piece,
then say, "It is good&mdash;but not good enough for
Josiah Wedgewood."  Then it would be
destroyed.  Day after day he sat with his
workmen, going from one to another, rendering
assistance and seeking to give to each one a
very high ideal for work.  He had to face
great difficulties.  Many of the tools in use
were of no service whatever in his porcelain
ware.  He had often to greatly improve the
tools, and in many cases invent new ones
altogether.  But he was not easily daunted, and his
marvellous perseverance overcame all difficulties.
</p>

<p>
He was married to Sarah Wedgewood in
1764, when he was thirty-four years of age
and she was twenty-nine.  For many years she
had been a great inspiration to him in his
work and she continued to be throughout his life.
</p>

<p>
Four years after this his leg, which had
seldom allowed him to have one day without
pain for twenty-two years, became worse.
After consultation with several doctors it was
decided to have the limb amputated.  There
were no anæsthetics in those days by which the
patient in such a severe operation could be
made unconscious, and so without anything to
alleviate the pain he suffered the operation.
He did not shrink but bore the pain with
magnificent courage.  It was not his way to
complain.  During the twenty-two years of
suffering he had very seldom said a word about
his agony.
</p>

<p>
By this time Josiah Wedgewood was known
throughout England and in many lands far
beyond.  There was great interest taken when
his leg was amputated and many of the leading
people of England, including the King and
Queen, were greatly relieved when it was
known that the operation had been a success.
When he regained his strength he soon
returned to the work he loved so much and
sought to make his products more perfect.
</p>

<p>
Probably there has never been a more skilled
potter than Josiah Wedgewood.  There have
been other skilful men, but they have almost
always copied one from another.  He followed
out his own ideas.  When a boy, walking
several miles to and from school each day over
the wide moorland, he had noticed the
exquisite tints of the wild flowers.  When he
became a potter he copied out those same flowers
in his marvellous designs.  He did not copy the
works of other men; he followed as his ideal
the things which God had made.  He was by
far the most original potter that the world has
ever seen.  His business became one of the
great industries of England and he and Sarah
built an ideal village called Etruria, where
they lived with their daughter Susannah, who
became the mother of the famous scientist,
Charles Darwin.
</p>

<p>
And so it was that the crippled boy, who left
school at nine, and for long years was hardly
ever a day without violent pain, became the
greatest potter the world has ever known.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE DUTCH BOY WHO BECAME A GREAT EDITOR.
</h3>

<p>
When the ocean liner, <i>The Queen</i>,
docked at New York on September 20,
1870, she discharged among her
passengers a Dutch family named Bok.  Mr. Bok,
the father, had once been in fairly good
circumstances, but unwise investments had left
him quite poor, so he and his wife decided to
leave Holland, and with their two boys,
William and Edward, start over again in the
United States.
</p>

<p>
The younger boy, Edward, was not quite
seven years of age.  Within a few days of
landing he and his brother were sent to a
public school in Brooklyn.  It seemed a hard
beginning, for neither of the boys knew one
word of English.  They did not know what
the other boys were talking about, nor could
they make themselves understood.  In their
helplessness they did not have the sympathy of
each other's company for they were graded
according to age, and so were parted during
school hours.  As soon as school was dismissed
the boys were each the centre of a group of
tormentors, who seemed to enjoy teasing the
little fellows who could neither speak, nor
understand, a word of English.  Edward was
nick-named "Dutchy" and there was scarcely
any form of cruelty which the other boys did
not inflict upon him.
</p>

<p>
One day Edward was goaded into fury and
turned on the ringleader among his tormentors.
Much to the surprise of the big bully,
and to the boys, Edward gave him a sound
thrashing, and from that day on, he had the
respect, at least, of his schoolmates.  He
learned the language quickly, and although he
spoke with a Dutch accent, he adapted himself
to the ways of the new country and gained
confidence.
</p>

<p>
Edward's father did not find it easy to make
good.  He was between forty and fifty years of
age and everything was new and strange.  He
could not find work for quite a long time and
the strain began to tell upon his wife's health.
Edward and his brother were quick to see how
the heavy burdens were weighing upon their
mother, so they decided to relieve her by
rising early in the mornings; building the fire,
preparing the breakfast, and washing the
dishes, before they went to school.  After
school they gave up their play and swept and
scrubbed, and helped their mother to prepare
the evening meal, and wash the dishes afterwards.
</p>

<p>
One morning the boys woke up to find that
there was no kindling wood or coal wherewith
to build the fire, so they decided to go out
each evening to gather coal which had been
carelessly spilled when coal was being
delivered.  A good deal of wood was also lying
about the streets which they were glad to get.
The mother remonstrated with the boys, but
Edward said: "It is all right, Mother; this is
America, where one can do anything if it is
honest.  So long as we don't steal why
shouldn't we get it?"
</p>

<p>
Money was badly needed in that home and
Edward looked around to see if he could not
earn something.  One day he was standing
looking longingly into the window of a
baker's shop.  The baker had just put a tray
of tempting buns, tarts, and pies, in the
window and he came out to look at them.
</p>

<p>
"They look pretty good, don't they?" he
said, noticing the wistful look on Edward's face.
</p>

<p>
"They look all right," answered the little
Dutch boy, "but they would look a whole lot
better if you had your window cleaned."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," said the baker, "perhaps
you will clean it."
</p>

<p>
So Edward got his first job.  He cleaned
that window every Tuesday and Friday
afternoon, for which he received <i>fifty cents
a week</i>.  One day the baker was busy and
Edward waited on a customer.  When the
baker saw how aptly he did it, he
suggested that Edward help him on certain
days after school and on Saturday
afternoons.  The salary was to be one dollar
and fifty cents a week.  Edward eagerly
consented and hurried home to tell his parents
about his rare good fortune.  On Saturday
mornings he took a delivery route for a
newspaper, for which he received one dollar; thus
he brought his weekly earnings up to two-fifty.
</p>

<p>
One evening Edward was invited to a party
in Brooklyn.  The thought occurred to him
that the hostess would probably like to see an
account of the party in the newspaper, so he
wrote an account of it, giving the name of
every boy and girl present, and sent it to the
<i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>.  The editor of the newspaper
was so pleased with the idea that he offered to
give Edward three dollars a column for such
news.  From that time Edward sought eagerly
to find out where parties were being held in
order to keep the editor supplied with news
and to earn some much-needed money.  It
pleased people who had attended parties to see
their names in print, and, of course, it
increased the circulation of the paper.  Edward
was not yet thirteen, but he was attending
school, working in a bake-shop after hours,
serving a paper route on Saturday mornings,
and acting as reporter for a newspaper.
</p>

<p>
One evening Edward learned that an office
boy was wanted in the office of the Western
Union Telegraph Company.  The salary was
six dollars and twenty-five cents a week.
Edward secured the position, and so, at the early
age of thirteen, he left school to make his way
in the world.  His mother was keenly
disappointed at his having to leave school so early,
but owing to the straitened circumstances of
the home, she gave her consent.
</p>

<p>
Edward early developed habits of thrift.
He never lost a chance of making five cents,
and when he got it he did not spend it foolishly.
He never used a street-car if he could
walk.  Thus, he was able to buy books to
improve his education, and to make up for the
serious handicap of having left school so early
in life.
</p>

<p>
About this time he began to collect
autographs.  He wrote to President Garfield,
Lord Tennyson, Whittier, General Sherman,
Geo. W. Childs, and a great many other
notables, and secured their autographs, and in
several instances received friendly little
letters.  One day a newspaper reporter saw these
letters and within a few days a long article
appeared in the New York <i>Tribune</i>, giving a
full account of the little Dutch boy who had
secured such a remarkable collection of autographs
and letters.  Editors of several leading
newspapers and magazines wrote to Edward
and encouraged him to get into personal touch
with as many distinguished people as he could,
and to write brief accounts of his experiences.
Thus encouraged, Edward sought and obtained
interviews with President Garfield, General
Grant, General Sherman, President Hayes,
Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, Oliver Wendell
Holmes, Longfellow, Phillips Brooks,
Emerson, and many others.  In every case the
boy's eagerness to learn, and courteous
conduct made a favourable impression and he was
received with uniform kindness.
</p>

<p>
When Edward was eighteen his father died
and the small amount of insurance he left
barely covered the funeral expenses.  Hence
the two boys faced the problem of supporting
their mother on their meagre income.  The
boys there and then determined to make their
mother comfortable.
</p>

<p>
At this time he was a member of
Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, where the great
Henry Ward Beecher was pastor.  The Young
People's Society of the Church decided to
publish a magazine and Edward was asked to
become editor.  He made a decided success of
this task and before long a good deal of
attention was directed to the magazine.  Edward
published sermons by Dr. Beecher, Dr. Talmage
and others, and besides he got a number
of prominent people to write for it.  Readers
were amazed when they opened its pages to
find articles signed by the greatest people in
the country.  At first, the circulation of this
little publication, which was named <i>The
Brooklyn Magazine</i>, was small, and Edward
and another boy wrapped up all the copies
themselves and took them to the post office.
As the circulation increased the bundles were
too heavy to be carried, and a baker's cart
had to be used.  Before long a double-horse
truck was necessary, and three trips had to be
made.  All this time Edward was working for
the Western Union Telegraph Company in the
day time and doing his editorial work in the
evenings.  In 1882&mdash;when, he was nineteen&mdash;he
gave up his position and devoted his
whole time to editing and publishing the
magazine, which was now known as <i>The
American Magazine</i>, and had become an
important publication.
</p>

<p>
In 1884, before Edward had reached his
twenty-first birthday, he was offered a
position with the well-known book publishers,
Charles Scribner and Sons, which he accepted.
The salary was eighteen dollars a week, which
in those days was considered a good salary for
one so young.  He astonished every one by his
energy and enterprise.  There wasn't a lazy
bone in his body.  He had an ever-willingness
to work which made his success a certainty.
When he got out into the world he was
astonished to find how many of his young,
friends believed that the only way to get on
was through favouritism.  That was not his
experience.  He found that if a young man
were willing to work, and to do his very best,
the way to success was wide, and it was not
overpeopled.  He was amazed to find how
many young men there were who were not
doing their best, or anything like it.  They
were constantly watching the clock, and afraid
lest they should work one minute more than
they were being paid for.  When luncheon
time came, Edward listened to the conversation
around him and he was surprised to note
that scarcely any youth ever gave a thought
to anything except wages and outside interests.
</p>

<p>
Edward's idea of work was different.  He
resolved to do his very best and to do it every
hour of the day.  He did all that was expected
of him and a little more.  When others played,
he worked, convinced that his play-time would
come later.  He met with many difficulties,
but he overcame them with a smile.  He liked
fun and play just as much as any other fellow,
but he felt that he ought not to take his
employers' time for these things, and he felt that
owing to the circumstances in his own home, it
was up to him to make good.
</p>

<p>
In 1889, while he was still a young
man&mdash;twenty-six years of age&mdash;he accepted the
position of editor of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>
and moved to Philadelphia.  When he took
over this magazine it had a circulation of over
400,000, and so was already very well known.
Under his able editorship it became one of the
most influential magazines in America&mdash;and
for that matter in the world.  Edward Bok
remained as editor for thirty years, and,
under his direction, and largely owing to his
great skill and hard work, the circulation grew
until, when he resigned in 1919, the circulation
was over <i>two million</i>.
</p>

<p>
Edward Bok was sitting one evening chatting
with Theodore Roosevelt, who was at that
time President of the United States.  The
President said, "Bok, I envy you your power
with the public."
</p>

<p>
Edward Bok replied, "That is a strange
remark from a President of the United States."
</p>

<p>
"You may think so," Roosevelt said, "but
what you write is read by thousands when
their day's work is over, and the mind is at
rest.  You have it on me: I envy you your
power with the public."  This illustrates, at
least, what a tremendous influence the little
Dutch boy had become in the nation, and in
the world.
</p>

<p>
As editor of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>,
Edward Bok did a great many things which
helped to make him one of the most prominent
and useful citizens of the United States.
He gave prizes to those who succeeded in
securing new subscribers.  Remembering his
own lack of opportunity to secure an education,
he hit upon the simple plan of giving free
scholarships as premiums to the most successful
canvassers.  This plan grew so that nearly
all the leading colleges were included, and by
1919 no less than one thousand four hundred
and fifty-three free scholarships had been
awarded.  By this plan it was made possible
for many to obtain an education who later
filled conspicuous places in the business and
professional world.
</p>

<p>
Edward Bok was twice asked to become
American Ambassador to Holland, the land of
his birth.  It would certainly have seemed a
wonderful thing if he could have returned in
such a high position to the land he left as a
poor boy, but he did not see his way clear to
accept the post.  He enjoyed the confidence
and close friendship of such men as President
Cleveland and President Roosevelt.  In fact
there was hardly an outstanding man in the
United States with whom Edward Bok did
not come into contact.
</p>

<p>
In 1918, he was invited by the British
Government to join a party of thirteen American
editors who were to visit Great Britain and
France.  On this trip he met many of the most
distinguished military men and statesmen of
the Allied nations.  His visit to the battlefields
made a great impression upon him and he was
deeply moved at the courage of the Allied
soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Edward Bok resigned from the editorship
of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> in 1919.  He has
since turned his attention to many things, for
which his previously busy life left little room.
He has been the recipient of many degrees
from the great American Universities, and
today, he who came to America's shores unable
to speak one word of English, is recognized as
a citizen of whom America may well be proud.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
A DEAF BOY WHO BECAME A GREAT BIBLE SCHOLAR.
</h3>

<p>
John Kitto was born at Plymouth, in
the south of England, on December 4,
1804.  His father, who was by trade a
stone-mason, was a man of intemperate habits,
and as a result there was constant poverty in
the Kitto home.  John never went to school for
more than a few days in his life.  At ten years
of age he began to help his father and often
had to stagger along under very heavy loads,
or climb ladders carrying slates for the roof.
For two years the boy did almost a man's
work, and then, one day as he was ascending
a ladder carrying a heavy load of slates, he
missed his footing and fell a distance of
thirty-five feet.  A group of terrified
workmen gathered around him and he was carried,
limp and bleeding, to his humble home.
</p>

<p>
For two weeks he seemed more dead than
alive.  Then one day he awoke and tried to get
up.  He did not understand his inability to
rise.  When his mother came he asked for a
book which, in spite of his lack of schooling,
he had learned to read.  His mother answered
his inquiry by writing upon a slate.  Then it
was that the sad truth slowly dawned upon
John Kitto that, as a result of his terrible
accident, his sense of hearing had been totally
destroyed.  Several remedies were tried, but
they were of no avail.  The injury to the nerve
of the ear was such that he could not hear
any one speak, in fact he could not hear even
the loudest music.  Thus John Kitto, not yet
thirteen years of age, found himself shut up
into a world of his own in which his chief
companions were books.
</p>

<p>
He was unable to help his father any longer
and tried to make a little money by painting
signs, such as, "Lodgings to Let".  This,
however, did not prove to be much of a source of
income, and so his parents sent him to
Plymouth workhouse, where he was taught the
trade of shoemaking.  When fifteen years of
age he was apprenticed to a man named
Bowden.  This man treated the deaf boy with much
cruelty.  John was compelled to work hard
from six o'clock in the morning until ten
o'clock at night, thus working for sixteen
hours each day.  Even then the boy's great
love for reading showed itself, for weary
though he was, he spent some of the time
allowed him for sleep, in poring over books.  At
length the cruelty of his employer became
more than he could bear, so he complained to
the authorities.  He was released from his
contract and taken back to the workhouse.  There
he remained for another four years, reading
very eagerly the few books which were
obtainable.  The poor boy was practically denied
companionship with other young people, not
only because he was deaf, but also because,
not being able to hear other people speak, he
largely lost the art of speech himself.  This
difficulty increased as the years went by, until
people who were strangers could only make
out what he said with great difficulty.
</p>

<p>
His studious habits soon began to attract
attention.  He wrote some articles to the
<i>Plymouth Journal</i> which were read with much
interest.  A public subscription was taken up
for him in the town and he was sent to a
school, that he might learn to become a printer
for a missionary society.
</p>

<p>
Just about this time he came into contact
with a Mr. Groves, a dentist of Exeter, who
was greatly attracted to the deaf boy.  He
was engaged as a tutor of Mr. Groves' sons;
and also several other pupils were secured for
him.  By this time he had become much
interested in learning languages, and had
mastered several, including Hebrew.  Then
something happened which changed everything
for John Kitto.  He was taken by Mr. Groves
on a trip abroad, which included long
sojourns in Russia, Persia, the Caucasian
Provinces, and other places in the East.  Four
years were spent abroad, and they were great
years for John Kitto.  Probably the extent of
his misfortune had sharpened his other
faculties; at all events his observation was
unusually keen and nothing escaped him.  He
returned to England in 1833 and wrote a series
of very interesting articles for the <i>Penny
Magazine</i>, signed, "The Deaf Traveller".  His
sojourn abroad had given him an insight into
Eastern life and customs.  On his return to
England he decided to publish some books
which would make the life of Palestine more
vivid and thus increase interest in the Bible.
Accordingly he published "The Pictorial
Bible", in three large volumes.  At that time
very few books had been written with such a
purpose and they were eagerly read by Bible
students.  Several years later&mdash;in 1845&mdash;he
published his greatest work, and one which has
entitled him to a foremost place among Bible
commentators: "The Cyclopædia of Biblical
Literature".  This extensive work reveals an
amazing amount of painstaking research.
For a great many years it was regarded as
indispensable for those who wished to closely
study the Scriptures.  While it is not nearly
so well known now it is certain that most of the
valuable material it contains has been made
use of by later writers who have worked along
similar lines.  In addition to the foregoing
books John Kitto wrote a large number of
others, and also many magazine articles.
Gradually his reputation spread and he
became recognized as one of the great Bible
scholars of his day.
</p>

<p>
He was a man of very regular habits and
almost every waking moment was spent at his
work of reading and writing.  He rose as
early as four o'clock in the morning, did a
little gardening, then worked in his study
nearly all day long.  Several people visited
him and tried to carry on some kind of a
conversation, but seldom with much success.
At first the method of talking by finger
signs was tried, but few could understand
it.  Later he tried to hold some kind of
intercourse by writing everything down; but
this was so painfully slow that it was given
up.  Thus it came about that even those who
wanted to help him, realized that their visits
were a strain upon him and that he seemed
happier when left alone.
</p>

<p>
There was one family, however, where there
were several children, all of whom loved him
very much.  Each one of them learned to use
finger signs and were never so proud as when
they would carry on some sort of conversation
with the great scholar.  He was deeply touched
by the friendship of these children, and
although he could not hear them as they
practised on the piano, he could feel the
vibration by placing his fingers on the
soundingboard and in that way marked their
progress in music.
</p>

<p>
John Kitto married and had children of his
own, whom he loved dearly, although he never
heard them speak.  In spite of the great value
of his books his income was never very large
at any time.  In 1850 he was granted a civic
pension of five hundred pounds a year.  In
those days that was considered a good income
and no doubt it did much to lift the burden of
anxiety from his mind.  There certainly was
no mistaking the high regard which was felt
for him everywhere.  Although a layman he
was granted the degree of Doctor of Divinity
by the University of Giessen in 1845.  He was
also made a Fellow of the Society of
Antiquaries the same year.
</p>

<p>
In 1851 his health began to fail and some
time later he went to Germany to try the
mineral waters there.  He did not obtain the
desired benefit, however, and he died at
Cannstadt in 1854, having reached the age of fifty.
His passing was greatly mourned in England,
for the boy from Plymouth workhouse, living
for nearly forty years under a terrible
handicap, had found a place of very great
usefulness in the world.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
THE SLAVE BOY WHO BECAME A GREAT LEADER.
</h3>

<p>
Some time about the year 1858 or 1859 a
negro child was born in a log cabin in
Virginia, U.S.A.  The parents of the
child were slaves, and utterly without
education.  When the child grew to be a man he
could never find out the exact date, or even the
year of his birth.  The first things he
remembered were the scenes around the squalid,
little log cabin, where his earliest years were
spent.  The cabin itself was sixteen feet by
fourteen.  It not only had to serve as the sole
home for the family, but was used as the
kitchen for the plantation.  There were no
windows in it, only openings in the side which
let in the light.  The same openings, of course,
let in the chilly air in winter.  A broken-down
door hung on uncertain hinges.  In one corner
of the miserable cabin there was a "cat hole"&mdash;a
hole about seven or eight inches square&mdash;to
enable the family cat to pass in or out.  As
there were half a dozen other holes in the
cabin walls, this contrivance seemed
unnecessary.  There was no wooden floor to the
cabin, the bare earth being considered all that
was necessary.  In the centre of the floor there
was a large, deep hole which was used to store
sweet potatoes during the winter.  There was
no stove in the cabin, all the cooking being
done over an open fireplace.
</p>

<p>
The little negro boy&mdash;whose name was
Booker Taliaferro Washington&mdash;never knew
what it was to sleep in a bed.  With his brother,
John, and his sister, Amanda, he slept on a
bundle of filthy rags on the dirty floor.  The
poor mother, who acted as cook to the slaves
on the plantation, had little or no time to give
to the training of her children, so they just
grew up, and early learned to do hard work.
</p>

<p>
The family never sat down around the table
together for a meal, nor was God's blessing
ever asked upon the food.  Like most other
slaves at that time, they hardly ate like
civilized beings.  The children got their meals
very much like dumb animals.  It was a piece
of bread here, and a scrap of meat there, and
perhaps a potato in another place.  Sometimes
one member of the family would eat out of a
pot, or skillet, while another would be eating
from a tin plate on his knees, often using
nothing but the hands to hold the food.  One
day, when young Booker was over at the
slave-owner's house, he saw two of the young ladies
eating gingerbread.  It seemed to him, at that
time, that the most tempting thing in the
world was a piece of gingerbread, and he
made a solemn vow that if ever he could afford
to buy some gingerbread he would do so.
</p>

<p>
Young Booker had little time for play, in
fact he hardly understood what the word
meant.  He cleaned the yard, carried water to
the slaves in the field, and once a week took
corn to the mill.  This last job was
heartbreaking.  A heavy bag of corn would be
thrown over the back of a horse, but as the
horse jogged along the uneven road, often the
bag would fall off, and probably young Booker
would fall with it.  He was not strong enough
to get it back upon the horse, and so he would
have to wait, maybe for several hours, for a
chance passer-by to help him.  These hours of
waiting would often bring bitter tears, for he
knew he would be late in reaching home.  It
was a lonely, dark road, and he was much
afraid, and besides, when he did get home, he
generally received a severe flogging for being
so late.
</p>

<p>
When Booker was about eight years of age
the slaves were liberated, and he, with his
mother and brother and sister, set out for
West Virginia, where his stepfather worked in
the salt mines.  The family packed up their
few belongings, and, with very little money,
set out on the long and tedious journey of
several hundred miles.  The children walked most
of the way, until their feet were sore and
blistered.  It took them several weeks to make
the journey, and they slept, either in the open
or in some abandoned cabin by the roadside.
</p>

<p>
Although he was only a child, Booker was
put to work in the salt mines as soon as they
reached Maiden, where his stepfather lived.
There was no play for him, nothing but hard
work.  Sometimes he had to rise at four
o'clock in the morning, and work until he was
nearly dropping from sheer exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
Once when he was a little fellow, he had
taken some books to the school house for his
young mistress.  He looked in and saw several
dozen white boys and girls learning to read
and write, and it seemed a wonderful thing to
him.  He thought that getting into school must
be like getting into Paradise.  Once he got
settled in Maiden a great desire to learn to
read came over him.  In some way a copy of
Webster's spelling book found its way to their
cabin, and he eagerly began to learn the
alphabet.  At that time there was no single
person of his race whom he knew, who could
spell, and he was afraid to ask the white
people.  But in some way he learned what the
letters stood for, and soon he began to spell out
simple words.  His mother was totally ignorant,
but she encouraged him all she could.
</p>

<p>
About this time some kind of a school for
coloured children was opened in the town, and
a young negro who had learned to read was put
in charge.  Booker's stepfather, however,
decided that he could not afford to lose the money
that he was earning, and that he must continue
to work in the salt mines.  This was a most
crushing blow to the negro boy who was so
anxious to learn.  However, he succeeded in
persuading the teacher to give him lessons at
night, and he worked hard, although he was
often tired in body.  After a while he was
allowed to attend day school, on the understanding
that he also did his work in the mines.  So
he worked in the mines from very early in the
morning until nine o'clock, when school
opened, and again he returned when school
hours were over.
</p>

<p>
When he did get to school he found
difficulties.  All the other boys had "store" caps,
of which they were very proud.  Booker had
none, nor had his mother any money wherewith
to buy one, but she sewed two pieces of
cloth together, which answered for a "cap".
The other boys made great fun of his homemade
cap, but he knew it was the best that his
mother could do, so he tried to ignore their
ridicule.  Young Booker had heaps of trouble,
and difficulties at every turn, but there never
was a time in all those hard years when he did
not have the determination to secure an education.
</p>

<p>
One day, while he was working in the mine,
young Booker overheard two men talking
about an advanced school for coloured boys at
some distance away.  In the darkness he crept
closer, and he heard one of the men say that
opportunities for work were provided, so that
worthy pupils could pay part of their board,
and at the same time be taught some trade.
That was a turning point in his life.  He
determined there and then to get to that school.
Once he had formed that resolution, the idea
never left him day or night.
</p>

<p>
By means of very hard work he managed to
save enough money to start him on the road
to the school, which was known as Hampton
Normal and Agricultural Institute.  After
many hardships and bitter experiences, he
arrived there, but when he presented himself
before the head teacher she hesitated about
taking him in.  He was tired after the long, weary
journey, and his clothes were worn threadbare.
He looked like a worthless tramp.  After some
hesitation the teacher gave him a broom, and
told him to sweep a room.
</p>

<p>
Did he sweep that room clean?  He never
tackled anything with so much delight.  He
swept it, then dusted it four times.  He rubbed
every piece of furniture in that room until it
shone.  He felt that his future depended upon
the way he cleaned that room.  When he had
finished the head teacher came and examined
his work.  She couldn't find a particle of dust
anywhere.  "I guess you will do to enter this
institution," she said.
</p>

<p>
He spent three years at Hampton.  They
were hard years in many ways, for he had little
money, and besides, he had to learn everything,
almost from the beginning.  But he was
sheer grit, and things which would have
discouraged others only made him more
determined.  He soon gained a grasp of his
studies, and, by very hard grinding, worked
his way to the front in his classes.  After his
course was completed he was made a teacher
in the institution, and put in charge of a group
of Indians, with whom he did remarkably well.
</p>

<p>
Then a great opportunity opened up for
him.  A normal school for coloured people was
to be opened in Tuskegee, Alabama.  A great
many schools for coloured children had been
opened since the abolition of slavery, but most
of the teachers themselves were not educated,
and this normal school was instituted for their
benefit.  Booker T. Washington was asked if
he would take charge of it, and he gladly did
so.  He began his work in a disused shanty
with about thirty pupils, practically all of
whom had been trying to teach school.
</p>

<p>
Soon the shanty became too small for those
who came, and Booker Washington saw a
large, old disused plantation house, which he
decided to purchase and use as a school.  He
succeeded in raising the necessary five
hundred dollars, and soon the whole school moved
into the larger premises.
</p>

<p>
Under his leadership the school grew by
leaps and bounds.  The coloured people were
so thankful for the institution that they
brought live cattle, as they could afford it, and
these animals were used to maintain the institution,
and as a means to train the negroes for
farming.  Very soon the school owned two
hundred horses, colts, mules, oxen, calves, and
over seven hundred pigs, sheep and goats.  It
became necessary to add to the buildings, and
soon the work of Tuskegee Institute became
known the whole world over.  After a few
years the school which Booker Washington
began in an old shanty, had grown to be an
institution with eleven hundred pupils and a
staff of eighty-six officers and teachers.
</p>

<p>
Booker T. Washington&mdash;now known everywhere
as Professor Washington&mdash;became one
of the greatest orators in the United States.
Often he made speeches before tremendous
audiences, and always succeeded in raising the
white man's idea of the coloured people.  He
became a close personal friend of Grover
Cleveland, at that time President of the
United States, and several times he was
invited to the White House, to be guest of the
President.  Later, he visited England, and was
welcomed by Queen Victoria, and many of the
most distinguished people of Great Britain.
He received the honourary degree of Master of
Arts from Harvard University, and it is safe
to say that the little negro boy, who began life
under such great handicaps, became one of the
most highly respected of the world's citizens.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
THE IMMIGRANT LAD WHO BECAME A KING OF INDUSTRY.
</h3>

<p>
In November, 1837&mdash;the year in which
Queen Victoria ascended the throne&mdash;Andrew
Carnegie was born in Dunfermline,
Scotland.  His father was a weaver,
and before the invention of the steam loom,
made a comfortable, if modest, living.
Andrew's mother early impressed upon him
that economy was a virtue, a lesson which he
never forgot in later days.  On one occasion
Mrs. Carnegie asked her children to repeat a
proverb from the Bible.  When it came to
Andrew's turn, he stood up and said, "Take
care of the pence and the pounds will take care
of themselves".  While Andrew was mistaken
in thinking this was in the Bible, it shows how
deeply it had been fixed in his mind.
</p>

<p>
One day Andrew's father came home very
dejected.  "Andy," he said, "I have no more
work."  Up till that time all weaving had been
done on hand looms, and the introduction of
the steam looms threw hundreds of men out of
work.  Andrew never forgot how bitter and
harsh his father's words sounded.  "No more
work!"  That meant no more money, and
poverty stared them in the face.
</p>

<p>
Andrew's father could not obtain work in
the town.  Hundreds of others, like himself,
were thrown out of work.  It was no use
moving to another town for conditions were the
same everywhere.  After some anxious days of
planning together, the family decided that the
only thing to do was to follow the example of
some relations and move to the United States.
</p>

<p>
The Carnegies sold their hand looms and
household belongings, and got ready for their
long voyage.  There were only two children,
Andrew and his younger brother, Tom.  Those
were the days of sailing vessels, and crossing
the Atlantic meant a rough voyage of many
weary weeks and, after that, long and
tiresome railway journeys.  Andrew was only
eleven at this time.
</p>

<p>
The family reached Pittsburgh safely and
Mr. Carnegie obtained work at a cotton
factory.  Soon after this Andrew got a position
as a bobbin boy, at <i>one dollar and twenty
cents a week</i>.  He was delighted to be actually
earning money.  At the end of the first week,
when his wages were put into his hand, he felt
as happy as a king.  One dollar and twenty
cents, earned by his own efforts; how proud he
felt!
</p>

<p>
The work was hard and the hours of labour
very long.  He worked from early morning till
late at night, with only an interval of forty
minutes for dinner.  After a time he got
another situation which was, if anything, even
harder.  This work was to fire the boiler and
run the steam-engine which drove the
machinery of a small factory.  The work was so
hard that it soon began to tell upon his health.
Night and day he was haunted by the
possibility of a calamity, and in his sleep he would
often put out his hand to test the water-gauge.
</p>

<p>
Those were dark days for the young Scotch
boy, but he determined not to bring his
troubles into the home.  He was blessed with a
keen spirit of determination to succeed and, no
matter how hard he found his work, he never
complained.  There was poverty in the home,
but it was honest poverty and he was not
ashamed of it.  He often had to deny himself
pleasures which other boys could afford, and
had to wear his clothes long after they had
become shabby; but nobody ever heard him
grumble or complain.
</p>

<p>
When he became fourteen Andrew got a
position as a telegraph boy at <i>three dollars a
week</i>.  There was not a prouder boy in
Pittsburgh.  Besides the advance in wages, the work
was healthier.  He was so overjoyed with his
position that soon he began to fear lest he
should lose it.  He was not acquainted with the
business section of the city where he had to
deliver most of his messages, but he overcame
this by using his excellent memory.  He
committed to memory the exact location of all the
business houses in the principal streets, so that
when a telegram was handed to him, he knew
at once where it had to be delivered.
</p>

<p>
His regular habits and attention to his work
soon attracted the attention of those over him
and at the age of sixteen he was promoted to
the position of telegraph operator, at a salary
of three hundred dollars a year.  This advance
came at the right time, for Andrew's father
had just died and the burden of carrying on
the home fell upon Andrew's shoulders.  Soon
after this he accepted a position with the
Pittsburgh Division of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, at an increase of ten dollars a month.
</p>

<p>
At this time something happened which did
much to change his whole life.  Through the
interest of his superintendent it became
possible for him to purchase ten shares in The
Adams Express Company for five hundred
dollars.  Andrew's business instinct led him to
see that it was a splendid opportunity, and
his mother was just as anxious as he was to
make the venture.  After a consultation they
decided to mortgage their little home and
buy the shares.  This little transaction was
destined to be the forerunner of many successful
business deals.
</p>

<p>
One day, while he was travelling on the
railway, a man showed him the model of a
sleeping-car.  Such things were at that time
unknown, but Andrew saw instantly that the
invention was a good one, and made
arrangements for the inventor to meet the
superintendent of the railroad.  The outcome was
that a company was formed to build sleeping-cars,
and Andrew Carnegie was one of the
number.  Soon after this he was made
superintendent of the Pittsburgh division of the
Pennsylvania Railroad.
</p>

<p>
Not long after he was promoted to this
position the company began to make experiments
with an iron bridge.  Up to this time all
bridges had been built of wood.  The experiments
with iron proved successful.  There had
been so much delay on the railways by the
bridges being broken or burned that the
cast-iron bridges were welcomed.  Mr. Carnegie,
with his keen business instinct, saw at once
that iron bridges must displace the wooden
ones.  He formed a syndicate known as The
Keystone Bridge Works, and his first
undertaking was to build a bridge with a span of
three hundred feet over the Ohio River.  Thus
began the work of iron and steel constructions
which Mr. Carnegie followed up until he
became known throughout the world as the
"Steel King."
</p>

<p>
Before many years had passed Mr. Carnegie
not only owned his own immense iron
and steel works, but also a fleet of steamers
which were used to transport the iron ore
across the Great Lakes.  He built his own
railroad to convey the ore from the lake ports
to Pittsburgh, a distance of 425 miles.
</p>

<p>
In 1900 The Carnegie Steel Company was
organized with a capital of one hundred
million dollars.  The enormous concern gave
employment to 45,000 people.  One of the plants
alone covers an area of seventy-five acres.  It
is no exaggeration to say that it is by far the
greatest manufacturing concern of its kind in
the world.  When Mr. Carnegie decided to
retire he sold out his interest in the steel works
for two hundred and fifty million dollars.  It
was said at that time that he could give away
thirty-five thousand dollars a day and never
touch his capital.  For many years he gave
large sums of money for public libraries and
other enterprises which seemed to him to be
deserving of assistance.
</p>

<p>
Having worked his own way in the world,
from a very humble beginning to a position of
great power and influence, Mr. Carnegie never
had much patience with lazy people.  He
would never tolerate around him what are
known as "dead heads".  "Concentration," he
said, "is my motto.  First, honesty, then
industry, then concentration."  He expected
every one in his employ to be anxious to do
their best.
</p>

<p>
Throughout his life he was a man of good
habits, and a non-smoker, and attributed his
vigor of mind and body to the fact that he
avoided anything which would undermine his
health.  The careful religious training which
he received in his humble home in Scotland
had a lasting influence for good upon his life.
Clean living, honesty, and devotion to his
work, no matter how hard it was, made
Andrew Carnegie one of the foremost business
men of his generation.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
A SHOEMAKER'S APPRENTICE WHO BECAME A GREAT SCHOLAR.
</h3>

<p>
On the last day of November, 1852, a
lad was born near the village of
Llangernyw, in Denbigshire, Wales.
The proud father, who was the village shoemaker,
took the baby to church that same day,
and there he was baptized&mdash;Henry Jones.
</p>

<p>
Young Henry's parents were poor, and his
grandparents were if anything, poorer.  His
grandfather worked on the estate of the local
squire, and as he grew older his wages were
repeatedly reduced, until he was receiving
only four shillings a week.  But even this was
not the worst, for he was offered two shillings
and sixpence a week.  That seemed too much
for the old man, and very soon after he died.
</p>

<p>
The house in which young Henry was born,
was very small.  It consisted of one small room
downstairs, about ten feet square, and another
room the same size upstairs.  This tiny
downstairs room, was almost always terribly
overcrowded.  It had to serve as kitchen,
dining-room, and living-room all in one.  Seven
persons had their meals each day in that small
room.  How to find a seat for every one was a
problem, but a way out of the difficulty was
found by having the children take their meals
in relays.  Young Henry, being in a great
hurry to get out to play, often took his meals
standing, or sitting on the doorstep.
</p>

<p>
When Henry's little baby sister was born,
they all wondered how room could be found
for the cradle in that already over-crowded
room.  But there was a way out.  The cradle
was put upstairs, and a string let down from
it through a hole in the ceiling.  Whenever the
baby cried, the mother bade one of the children
pull the string, which rocked the cradle.  Many
a time Henry's play was interrupted so that
he might spend a time pulling that old string.
</p>

<p>
There was a constant struggle against
poverty in that home, for Elias
Jones&mdash;Henry's father&mdash;never earned more than
twenty shillings a week, and generally quite
a bit less.  The food was plain, but wholesome,
consisting for the most part of bread and milk
and "shot", that is, ground oat-cake and milk.
There were no dull moments in that home.  It
was crowded and restless all day long.  Either
the mother was cooking or the father was
heating his irons in the fire, or some of the
children were clamouring for bread and
butter, or perhaps a neighbour had dropped in to
see if his shoes were ready and then lingered
for a chat.  In spite of poverty, which
sometimes was severe, it was a happy home, for
each one sought to help the others.
</p>

<p>
Henry did not enjoy attending the village
school, in fact none of the children in that
village did.  The schoolmaster was very cruel and
ignorant.  The cane was very seldom out of
his hands.  Any fault or error was punished
very severely.  If a child whispered and the
master was not sure which one it was, he
thrashed the entire school.  In fact, there was
wailing and lamentation in that school the
whole day long, and small wonder that when
four o'clock came each day, the scholars
breathed more freely.
</p>

<p>
When the school holidays came around, each
year in June, the boys were sent out in gangs
to thin the turnips for the neighbouring
farmers.  The whole of the five weeks of summer
holidays were spent at this work.  The boys
were paid from eight-pence to one shilling a
day, fourpence being deducted if the farmer
provided meals.  Young Henry Jones went
with his brothers to do this hard work when
he was only five and a half years old.  When
evening came he was often too exhausted to
walk, and had to be carried home by the bigger
boys.  From that time until he was taken to
work as a shoemaker, Henry helped to thin
turnips each year.
</p>

<p>
While still a very young boy Henry began to
help his father make and repair shoes.  It was
the greatest ambition of his life to become a
good shoemaker.  One day an incident
happened which made him very proud.  Toe-caps
for boots were just coming into fashion, and
they had to be carefully stitched.  When it
came to putting on the caps, Elias Jones was
not sure of himself, so he went over to the
school and asked permission for Henry to
return home and do the sewing.
</p>

<p>
When twelve years of age Henry left school
to become a shoemaker's apprentice with his
father.  It was a happy moment in his life
when he put on the leather apron.  His mother
wanted him to be a blacksmith, or a gardener
like his brothers, or a grocer, anything in fact,
other than a shoemaker, but Henry stubbornly
refused to listen.  His mind was made up.  He
wanted to be a shoemaker like his father.  The
little workshop in which Henry and his father
worked, was a little lean-to at the gable-end of
the cottage.  Out of the window Henry could
see a barn and an old thatched cottage.  The
room was so small that those working had to
get into opposite corners so as not to interfere
with each other's movements.  Sometimes
there was a hired workman, and even a fourth
place was often made for the local postman,
who worked at making and repairing ladies'
boots between his arrival with the letters and
his departure.  Henry used to think that there
was so little room for privacy that it was
impossible to keep even one's thoughts to oneself.
</p>

<p>
Henry soon became a good shoemaker.  The
work was hard, and the hours very long, but he
liked it, and there was not a lazy bone in his
body.  Just at this time something happened
which had a great influence over Henry's life.
A lad named Tom Redfern, about his own age,
came to Llangernyw to take charge of the
school; a friendship sprung up between the
two, and soon Tom Redfern told Henry of his
ambition to attend the university.  Soon that
same ambition came to Henry, although it
seemed madness for him even to think about
such a thing, as his parents were so poor, and
his own education had been sadly neglected.
</p>

<p>
For some time Henry was most unhappy.  It
seemed to him as if there were no way
whereby his ambition could be realized.  But his
purpose became more resolute, and he made up
his mind that if at all possible he would reach
his goal.  At last arrangements were made
enabling Henry to attend a school at a place
called Pandy, some distance away, three days
each week.  Henry got out his old schoolbooks
and began to attend Pandy School every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  The remaining
three days he worked away at his trade harder
than ever.  There was an examination known
as the Queen's Scholarship held each year, and
successful students earned the right to attend
Bangor Training College for teachers.  Henry
determined to try for this, although it did
seem an almost impossible task.  He retired to
rest about eight o'clock each evening, and at
one o'clock in the morning the village
policeman tapped at his window.  Then he got up
and dressed and worked away at his books
until morning came.  There was so much to
be learned that at times he almost despaired,
but he never gave up.
</p>

<p>
At last the time came for him to try the
examination.  He went to Bangor in fear and
trembling.  One of his brothers had loaned
him a suit of clothes, and another brother
loaned him a watch.  He stayed at the college
during the days of the examination.  There
were quite a number of competitors, and only
a few could succeed.  Henry was appalled by
the look of cleverness and by the smart
appearance of most of the students.  He felt he
had made a horrible mistake in even giving in
his name.  When he was alone he wept like a
child and felt he had no chance whatever.
Although he was terribly nervous and covered
with confusion he did his best, and when the
examination results were published, a few
weeks later, his name appeared among those
who had passed in the first class.
</p>

<p>
He entered the training college at Bangor
and studied hard for two years.  He had to be
extremely careful, as he had very little money.
Throughout those two years he maintained his
place at the head of the college list, and then
in 1873&mdash;when he was just nineteen, he was
put in charge of a school at Brynamman, a
mining village in Wales.  He remained there
for two years, greatly beloved by the pupils in
the school, and by the people of the village.
Then in 1875 he passed the examinations for
entrance into Glasgow University.
</p>

<p>
The years Henry Jones spent at Glasgow
University were packed full of interest for
him.  There was much hard work for him, and
there was a constant struggle with poverty.
His parents were not in a position to help him,
and sometimes it almost seemed as though he
must give up, but somehow a way always
opened, and he was able to continue his studies.
At the close of his term he sat for an examination,
known as the "Clark Fellowship."  This
was the "blue ribbon," of the University,
and, of course, was the most coveted honour
among the students.  He had no intention of
trying for it, but one of the professors, who
was interested in him, persuaded him to sit for
the examination.  He did, and to his amazement,
he was awarded the prize, although all
the cleverest students of the University, who
were eligible, had also tried.  In addition to
the great distinction the fellowship carried
with it a grant of £225 (about $1,100) a year
for four years.  And then, for the first time in
his life, Henry Jones knew what it was to have
money to pay his way and a little left over.
</p>

<p>
A great day came for him, when in 1884 he
was elected to a professorship in Bangor
College, Wales.  He remained there for several
years, and then was made a professor in the
University of St. Andrews, in Scotland.  After
three years there&mdash;years of hard work, but of
great power and wide influence, he was elected
to a very important position; that of
Professor of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow
University.  This was one of the great positions in
the universities of Great Britain.  It was one
which only a great scholar could fill and Henry
Jones did fill it with credit to himself and with
very great profit to the students, for a period
of twenty-eight years.
</p>

<p>
From being a shoemaker's apprentice,
Henry Jones rose to a position of great power
and influence.  It was not by any means an
easy road.  There was a terrific struggle with
poverty, and at times it seemed as though it
would be too much for him.  But his tremendous
perseverence and grit carried him along,
and he succeeded to an extent that he had
never dared even to dream of.  During the
Great War he delivered scores of lectures
throughout Great Britain and in the United
States.  His three sons were on the firing line,
and the youngest of them was killed in France.
Henry Jones died in 1922, and left behind him
the memory of a brave and noble life.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
FROM GIPSY TENT TO PULPIT.
</h3>

<p>
In March, 1860, a family of gipsies camped
on a piece of land near Epping Forest, in
the south of England.  They were shiftless
people moving here and there over the country
according to their whims.  They were not
made welcome anywhere, for gipsies have a
reputation for dishonesty, and probably this
family named Smith were very much the same
as other members of their tribe.  But one day
during their stay in that place&mdash;to be exact
it was March 31st&mdash;a baby boy was born in
that gipsy tent, to whom his parents gave the
name of Rodney.
</p>

<p>
Rodney's parents earned their living very
much as other gipsies.  They travelled up and
down the country making and selling baskets,
tinware, clothespegs, and recaning cane chairs.
Rodney's father&mdash;whose name was Cornelius,
also made a business of buying and selling
horses.  Of course, young Rodney grew up
without education.  He travelled with his
parents and soon learned to go from house to
house selling clothespegs and other things.  He
was a bright lad and together with his brothers
and sisters, soon knew more about the flowers
and birds than most folks.  His parents could
neither read or write and so he was not
burdened with any kind of lessons.  He was
too young to understand the value of education
and so did not worry over that.  He was a
happy, care-free little fellow, when something
happened which changed his whole life.
</p>

<p>
Rodney's eldest sister was taken ill and the
father drove the gipsy wagon to the door of the
doctor's house.  The doctor climbed the steps
of the wagon, leaned over the door and called
the sick child to him.  "Your daughter has
small-pox," he said to Rodney's father.  "You
must get out of the town at once."  The
sorrow-stricken man drove his wagon about two
miles out of the town to a place called Morton
Lane.  There he erected a tent and then drove
the wagon farther down the lane with the sick
child in it.  He remained in the wagon with
the child while the mother and the other four
children lived in the tent.  Soon one of the
boys was taken ill and he also was removed to
the wagon.  Those were hard days for Rodney's
mother.  She would prepare the food for
her sick children, then carry it half-way from
the tent to the wagon, then give some signal
and the father would come for it.  In her
anxiety the poor mother seemed to approach
a little nearer to the wagon each day.  One day
she came too near.  She too, was taken ill, and
when the doctor saw her, he said it was smallpox.
</p>

<p>
For several days the man watched tenderly
over his wife and cared for her, but it was of
no avail; she gradually sank.  Rodney was
walking in the lane with his sister Tilly, when
his eldest sister called him.  "Rodney," she
said, "mother's dead."  The little gipsy lad
fell on his face as though he had been shot.
Rodney's mother was only a poor gipsy
woman without any education, but she was
mother, and the little fellow knew that
without her life would be much harder.
</p>

<p>
After his mother's death Rodney continued
to help his father by selling the homemade
clothespegs and tinware.  He was very proud
of the amount of business he could do.  Some
days he sold nearly nine hundred pegs.  He
was a bright-eyed little fellow, not at all
bashful, and he became a favourite in the towns
which the gipsies visited.  When women did
not wish to buy or seemed to hesitate, he
would say: "Come, now, Madam, here you
have the best pegs on the market.  They will
not eat and will not wear clothes out.  They
will not cry nor wake you up in the middle of
the night."  If they still hesitated, Rodney
would tell them that he had no mother.  It was
no wonder that with his humour and determination
he generally managed to do a good
business.
</p>

<p>
When Rodney was in his early teens his
father became a Christian.  It made a great
change for the better in Cornelius Smith and
life in that gipsy wagon became happier.  The
father was tremendously in earnest.  He gave
up his habits of drinking, stealing and
swearing, and wherever the wagon went he sought
some place of worship where he and his family
might learn more about God.  The change in
Cornelius Smith soon impressed the children
and Rodney decided to do as his father had
done, and committed himself in simple trust
to God.
</p>

<p>
Although he was at this time about fifteen,
Rodney Smith could neither read or write.  He
had never been to school a day in his life.
When he opened the Bible to try and read it,
he often had it the wrong way up.  As he
passed along the streets of towns where the
wagon was he tried to read the signs over the
shops, but it was hard work, and unless they
were very simple words he could not make
them out.  By trying in every spare moment,
however, he soon learned to read; slowly at
first, but gradually getting on better each day.
He bought a dictionary, and it was in constant
use.  Whenever he came to a word he did not
understand, down came the dictionary.  He
had a good memory, and once he looked up the
meaning of a word he seldom forgot it.  He
read the Bible a great deal and soon he began
to hope that some day he might be able to
preach.  He knew that for ten years he had
been roaming about the fields and streets,
when he ought to have been at school, but that
was not his fault, and he resolved to try and
make up for lost time.  He was a good singer
and he often sang at religious meetings in the
towns and villages they visited.  Then he
became bold enough to deliver short addresses.
As he had very little education, and had
scarcely read anything, these addresses were
very simple, but he was in earnest and did
much good.
</p>

<p>
Just at this time Rev. William Booth&mdash;later
known as General Booth&mdash;began a movement
which was known as the Christian Mission.
Mr. Booth heard about Rodney Smith, and
persuaded him to become a worker with him,
and Rodney agreed.  This was in 1877, when
he was seventeen years of age.
</p>

<p>
There was tremendous excitement in the
gipsy wagon when Rodney stated his intention
of becoming a preacher.  Rodney strode up
and down in front of the wagon with his three
or four books under his arm.  On the morning
of his departure Rodney dressed himself up
in the new clothes which he had bought with
what little money he had.  All his belongings
he packed into a box which he had bought for
sixty cents.  He bade good-bye to his father
and his brothers and sisters, and then this
young gipsy lad, with very little education and
scarcely any money, took the train for London
to engage in Christian work.  He arrived in
London that same evening and went to the
people with whom he was to live for the time
being.  That evening Rodney sat up to a table
for a meal, and used a knife and fork, for the
first time in his life.  He was terribly
embarrassed, and when a piece of linen was
placed beside his plate he did not know what
to do with it.  He thought it must be a pocket
handkerchief and said so to his hosts.  He
could see at once that he had made a mistake,
and overwhelmed with confusion he said:
"Please forgive me, I do not know any better.
I am only a gipsy boy, and have never been
taught what these things are.  I know I shall
make lots of blunders, but if you correct me
whenever I make a mistake I will be grateful.
I will never be angry, and never cross."
</p>

<p>
A serious difficulty confronted Rodney when
he had to conduct his first services alone.  He
could speak, pray, and sing, but as yet he
could read only with difficulty.  However, he
did his best.  He would commence to read a
chapter and if he came to big words that he
could not pronounce, he would stop and talk
a little, then begin to read again at the other
side of the big word.  He soon became known
as a good speaker and an earnest worker.  The
fact that he was a gipsy attracted people's
attention and before long he was speaking
regularly to large gatherings.
</p>

<p>
During the few years following Rodney
made great progress.  He soon learned to read
with ease and his addresses were listened to
with great interest.  He rose early in the
mornings and spent several hours in reading
and in devotions.  During the afternoons he
visited those in need, and in the evenings he
addressed meetings both in the open-air and in
halls.  He was often sent to towns where the
work of the Christian Mission was at a very
low ebb, but wherever he went it was the same,
his earnest preaching and sweet singing
attracted the people.
</p>

<p>
While he was stationed at Hull his congregations
were greater than ever.  Often fifteen
hundred people would be gathered at the
Sunday-morning prayer meeting at seven a.m.,
and the crowds at the regular services were so
great that often thousands would be unable to
get into the large building.  Rodney was by
this time married and known as "Gipsy
Smith", and the Christian Mission had become
the Salvation Army.  Under his care the work
at Hull grew so that 15,000 copies of the <i>War
Cry</i> were sold each week.
</p>

<p>
From Hull Gipsy Smith was sent to Hanley.
Here he found a small number of people
worshipping in a large building which had been a
circus.  Soon the old circus which held 2,500
people was crowded to the doors, and crowds
as great, if not greater, than those which had
gathered at Hull, came to hear the gipsy.
There was a great revival of religion and the
influence of it was felt for many miles around.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this Gipsy Smith began work as
an evangelist among the churches, and he has
continued to do this with great success up to
the present time.  In 1886, at the earnest
request of some friends, he paid his first visit to
America.  When he arrived in New York he
was scarcely known to any and the idea of a
gipsy preacher rather startled the ministers
and members of the churches.  After some
hesitation the minister of a large church
agreed to have Gipsy Smith conduct a mission
in his church.  It was a large building,
holding fifteen hundred people, but it was packed
from the first service, and continued so for the
three weeks that the gipsy was there.  Soon
more requests came in for services than the
Gipsy could grant.  The newspapers contained
glowing accounts of his work, and from all
sides came testimonies to the great good that
he had done.  Thousands of people were
blessed under his earnest preaching, and when
the time came for him to return to England
a vast number of people wished him god-speed.
</p>

<p>
People who heard Gipsy Smith preach could
scarcely believe that he had been born in a
gipsy tent and had never spent a day in school.
His use of the English language was so good,
and his thoughts so fine and clear, that it
seemed as if he must have received his
training in a university.  But he never forgot,
himself, nor did he wish any one else to forget,
what a very lowly beginning he had.
</p>

<p>
After his return to England Gipsy Smith
became an assistant to the Rev. F. S. Collier,
of Manchester.  Here he continued to be a
means of blessing to great numbers of people.
Sometimes he preached to congregations of
over five thousand, and always with good
results.  He soon became known as one of the
greatest evangelists of Great Britain and
wielded a great influence for good.
</p>

<p>
Gipsy Smith has paid several visits to
America, and each time he has risen higher in
the respect and love of the people.  Wherever
he goes crowds flock to hear him, and they are
never disappointed.  Americans have learned
to look upon his visits as red-letter days for
the churches, and if he could be spared from
the Homeland, he would be warmly welcomed
on this side of the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
Gipsy Smith has preached in nearly all
parts of the British Empire.  He has been, for
many years now, one of the great evangelists of
the homeland.  Thousands of people have been
made better by his simple, direct message.
Many great men have recognized in him a
prophet of God, and they have been glad to
honour him as such.  He has counted among
his friends some of the greatest men living,
yet he has never lost his simplicity and
gratitude to God for making him what he is.  Not
long ago he said: "I have had rich and strange
experiences.  I have lived in many houses, the
guest of many sorts and conditions of people.
I have been presented to two presidents of the
United States, dined with bishops and
archbishops.  In my study hangs a letter from her
late Majesty, Queen Victoria, and another
from a royal duchess, but the most treasured
things in my home are two pictures which
adorn the walls of my bedroom.  One is the
picture of the wagon in which my mother died,
and the other is a picture of a group of gipsies.
I never sleep in that room without looking at
these pictures and saying to myself: "Rodney,
you would have been there to-day but for the
grace of God.  Glory be to His name for ever."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
A BLIND MAN WHO BECAME POSTMASTER-GENERAL OF ENGLAND.
</h3>

<p>
On August 26th, 1833, just four years
before Queen Victoria began to reign,
Henry Fawcett was born at Salisbury,
England.  He was sent to a Dame's school
where he did not get on very well.  The
teacher said that he had a head like a colander,
and he was so slow in learning his lessons
that he became known as the dunce of the class.
Young Harry himself admitted that he did not
enjoy school.  He loved to be out in the open
and in the woods, but he went like a snail,
unwillingly, to school.
</p>

<p>
There was one thing which never failed him
and that was his appetite.  He was always
complaining that he did not get enough to eat.
When his family moved away from Salisbury
Harry went to a boarding-school, and in nearly
every letter he wrote home he said he was
nearly starving.  In one letter to his mother he
said: "Please, when the family has quite
finished with the ham bone, send it on to
me."  However, in spite of his complaints, he grew
stronger and bigger every day, until by the
time he was ten he was several inches taller
than his school mates of his own age.
</p>

<p>
When he was fourteen he was sent to a
school known as Queenwood College and he
began to take more interest in his studies.  He
worked hard while at this school and when he
was nineteen he entered the famous Cambridge
University.  Henry Fawcett was popular with
the other students from the first day that he
entered Cambridge.  He was very tall&mdash;over
six feet three inches in height&mdash;and he moved
around the college halls and over the campus
with enormous long strides.  He had an
exceedingly happy and good-natured disposition
and was welcome everywhere.
</p>

<p>
His greatest ambition in life was to fit
himself for service as a member of the British
Parliament.  He desired to enter Parliament
for no other reason than that of serving his
fellowmen.  There were so many laws which
seemed to him to be cruel and unjust; so many
heavy burdens weighing upon the shoulders of
the poorer classes, that he longed with all his
heart to be in a position where he could help
to make things better.
</p>

<p>
In order to fit himself for Parliament he
began to study law, but he had considerable
trouble with his eyes.  This was so serious that
he was forbidden to do any reading until they
were better.  He did not complain, but obeyed
the physician's orders.  He went to stay with
his family at Salisbury.  It was during this
visit that a terrible thing happened.  On the
morning of September 15, of 1858, he and his
father began to climb Harnham Hill, from
which a very fine view of the surrounding
country could be obtained.  Both father and
son had their guns, for they hoped to secure
some partridge.  As they were crossing a field,
Henry advanced in front of his father.  A
partridge arose and the father, who did not see
just how near Henry was, fired, and some of
the stray shot entered Henry's eyes, and from
that moment until his death he was totally
blind.
</p>

<p>
Henry Fawcett was just twenty-five when
this terrible accident happened.  He was taken
back to his father's house in a cart.  He
remained perfectly calm as he listened to the
doctor's verdict.  The curtain had fallen and
never again could he see the things which other
people saw, nor read the books and papers he
so dearly loved.  But from that day until his
death, twenty-six years later, no one ever
heard him complain nor give any outward sign
of the terrible disappointment which he must
have felt.  He did not wish people to openly
sympathize with him, and the scores of letters
which he received from well-meaning people,
intended to console him in his misfortune,
really gave him pain.  He wanted people to
forget that he was blind and treat him as one
of themselves.
</p>

<p>
He straightway determined that he would
continue to prepare himself to serve the
people in Parliament.  He knew that he was
handicapped, in such manner as perhaps no
other statesman had ever been, still he showed
a courage and perseverance which was extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
Soon after his accident he began to walk
about in the open.  He naturally stumbled at
his first step.  When some one caught him by
the arm to pick him up he said: "Leave me
alone; I've got to learn to walk without seeing
and I mean to begin at once&mdash;only tell me
when I am going off the road."
</p>

<p>
All who knew Henry Fawcett at this time
bear witness to his amazing courage and
cheerfulness.  If he had a heavy heart, he said
nothing of it to others.  Especially was this
true in his relations with his father and
mother.  Whenever he was with them he was
the life of the home, full of mischief as a
schoolboy, and with a hearty laugh that made
the house ring.  "I want to live to be ninety,"
he said, and he meant it.  He was the soul of
kindness and good nature.  No one ever knew
him to say a cruel or unkind thing, or to spread
a report that would injure any one.  Throughout
his life he sought to promote good-will
and understanding and he was never happier
than when he was helping some one who was
in difficulty.
</p>

<p>
He had a remarkable memory for voices&mdash;that
is a faculty which often becomes acute in
blind people.  It was said of him that if he
heard a voice once he never forgot it.
Sometimes when spoken to by a person whom he
had not heard for many years, a puzzled look
would cross his face, but it would suddenly
clear up as he called the person by name.  His
sense of hearing became so keen that he could
tell when his friends were not feeling as well
as usual from their voices.  Often he would
startle them by saying: "What's the matter
with you to-day, you're looking pale?"  A man
who had not been near him for twenty years
once spoke to him and without a moment's
hesitation Fawcett called him by name.
</p>

<p>
Henry Fawcett made two unsuccessful attempts
to enter Parliament.  He was defeated
in Cambridge in 1863 by only eighty-one votes
and a few months later he was defeated in
Brighton.  Many people voted against him
because they thought that blindness was too
severe a handicap for any man to become
really useful in that great assembly.  He
himself did not think so, however, and he made a
third attempt in 1865&mdash;when he was thirty-two
years of age&mdash;and this time he was elected.
</p>

<p>
It was a proud day for Henry Fawcett when
he entered Parliament.  After he became blind
no one, not even those who loved him most,
believed that it was possible.  Only a determination
that absolutely refused to be thwarted,
made his election possible.
</p>

<p>
Surrounded by many of the greatest statesmen
of the nineteenth century, the blind man
quietly took his place in Parliament.  During
his first session there he said very little.  He
had to learn the ways of Parliament, which is
a difficult task for any one, and made much
harder in his case.  He made his first speech in
March, 1866.  Unlike most men he had no
notes to help him.  He had to rely altogether
upon his fine memory.  His speech was
listened to with rapt attention.  The picture of
this tall, sightless man with earnest voice and
manner, cast a spell over the House, and even
those who disagreed with him were deeply
impressed by his fine appearance and earnest manner.
</p>

<p>
In the years which followed Henry Fawcett
made a great many speeches in Parliament.
He was by no means a silent member.  In
every good cause which came up for discussion
his voice was heard, and always on the side of
those who needed help.  Not only the struggling
people of the British Isles interested
him, but for several years he fought very hard
on behalf of the poor people in far-off India.
He became such a champion of the Indians
that he was nicknamed, "The member for
India," and he received many letters
expressing deep gratitude from those people
whom he could never hope to see.
</p>

<p>
He entered into a great many political battles,
but there was one thing which even his
opponents admitted; that was he never sought
anything for himself.  He laboured hard to
help those whose lot he considered was less
fortunate than his own.
</p>

<p>
In 1880 Henry Fawcett was made
Postmaster-General of England, a position of very
great importance and responsibility.  There
were over ninety thousand employees under
the administration of the postoffice.
</p>

<p>
One bright spring day Henry Fawcett took
up his duties at the General Post Office.  He
was introduced to the heads of the various
departments and to those next in rank.  As he
began to warmly shake the hands of all to
whom he was being introduced, some one
whispered to him, "It is not usual for Her
Majesty's Postmaster-General to shake hands
with any one in the office below the rank of
head of a department."  It took a good deal to
make Henry Fawcett indignant, but that
remark pretty nearly did it.  He said, "I
suppose I am at liberty to make what use I like
of my own hands."
</p>

<p>
He took a very great interest in all who in
any way served the Post Office.  From the
first day that he took over his position he
laboured hard to improve working conditions.
He interested himself in every employee and
nothing ever seemed too much trouble to this
blind man of almost infinite patience and
sympathy.  No doubt his wonderful kindness
meant that some took unfair advantage of him,
but he found his supreme happiness in realizing
that never before in the history of the
great English Post-Office system had the work
been done so thoroughly and to the satisfaction
of the public.  One of the great statesmen of
that day said that, "The Postoffice could never
have a more capable Postmaster-General, nor
its officers a truer friend."
</p>

<p>
In December, 1883, he was taken seriously
ill with diphtheria, and this was followed by
typhoid fever.  For a while his life was
despaired of, and it illustrates what a large place
in the life of his country the blind man had
filled, to know that all England read the
bulletins which told of his condition.  The Queen
herself, telegraphed every day, and sometimes
oftener.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fawcett recovered from this illness and
was soon at work again as hard as ever.  The
following year he was honoured with degrees
from many great universities, including
Oxford and Glasgow.  Then in November, 1884,
he was taken suddenly ill and quietly passed
away in the presence of his wife and daughter
and several friends.  He who had lived in total
darkness for nearly thirty years; years in
which he was never once heard to murmur or
complain, passed into the eternal light of
God's presence.
</p>

<p>
A whole nation mourned deeply when this
man of such magnificent courage was laid to
rest in the quiet churchyard at Salisbury,
where he had been born.  Tributes to his
memory were paid to him by the greatest in the
land.  Queen Victoria wrote a most touching
letter to his widow, and Hon. W. E. Gladstone
said that no man had become more deeply
enshrined in the memory of his
fellow-countrymen.  The terrible handicap of
blindness had not prevented Henry Fawcett from
becoming one of the greatest men of his generation.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE PLOUGHBOY WHO BECAME A FAMOUS NATURALIST.
</h3>

<p>
One evening, in the town of Dunbar,
Scotland, an excited lad hurried
through the streets shouting to his
schoolmates: "I'm gaun tae Amaraka the
morn!"  When they refused to believe him he
said, "Weel&mdash;just you see if I am at skule the
morn."
</p>

<p>
The lad was John Muir.  That evening, as
he and his brother, David sat by the fireside
learning their lessons, his father walked in
and said, "Bairns, you needna learn your
lessons the nicht, for we're gaun to America the
morn!"  The boys were wild with joy.  Even
the natural heart-pain of parting from their
grandparents, whom they deeply loved, was
quickly quenched as they conjured up pictures
of the life they were to lead across the seas.
Mr. Muir decided to take with him John, who
was eleven years of age, David, a brother,
aged nine, Sarah, who was thirteen.  Mrs. Muir
and four children remained in Scotland
until the new home was ready for them.
</p>

<p>
After a voyage of nearly seven weeks, in a
sailing ship, the immigrants arrived in America
and very soon after settled on their claim
in Wisconsin.  With the help of some neighbours,
Mr. Muir built a shanty in less than a
day, after the materials for the roof and walls
were ready.  From the first John Muir fell in
love with his surroundings.  To him the
wilderness was a glorious place.  He watched
the birds and animals, the trees and the
flowers, the streams and lakes&mdash;everything around
him filled him with delight.  It was a backwoods
farm, and the hard work of clearing the
farm began at once.  John enjoyed piling up
immense quantities of brushwood and making
huge fires.  Mr. Muir bought a yoke of oxen
and the task of clearing the land began in
earnest.  The lads were up early and late,
doing their best to help their father get the
place cleared and a frame house built, so that
the other members of the family, who had been
left behind in Scotland, could join them.  Late
in the fall, just before the winter snow began
to fall, the house was ready, and Mrs. Muir
and the other four children arrived.
</p>

<p>
John was the eldest of the boys, and his
father looked to him to do almost a man's
work.  The summer work was heavy, and
especially harvesting and corn-hoeing.  All the
ground had to be hoed over the first few years
and John had scarcely a minute to rest.  They
had no proper farm implements to begin with,
and the hoes had to be kept moving up and
down as if they were worked my machinery.
John took great pride in the amount of work
he was able to do, and very often worked
sixteen and seventeen hours a day.
</p>

<p>
In winter time John and his brothers arose
early to feed the cattle, grind axes, bring in
the wood, and dozens of other jobs that needed
to be done.  No matter what the weather was,
there was work to be done.  It was pioneer
farming, and it was only by long and hard
effort that it was possible to earn a livelihood.
</p>

<p>
John was put to work at the plough at
twelve years of age, when his head little more
than reached the handles.  For many years the
bulk of the ploughing on that hard backwoods
farm fell to his lot.  From the first he
determined to do as good ploughing as though he
were a man, and in this he did not fail.  None
could draw a straighter furrow.  The work
was made especially hard because of the tree
stumps which were everywhere on the half-cleared land.
</p>

<p>
To John's lot also fell the task of splitting
rails for the long lines of zig-zag fences.
Making rails was hard work and required no little
skill.  Sometimes John would cut and split
one hundred rails a day from short, knotty,
oak timbers, swinging the heavy mallet from
early morning to late at night, until his hands
were sore.  He was proud of the amount of
work that he was able to do, but the heavy
exertions of those days probably prevented his
growth and earned for him the title of the
"Runt of the Family."
</p>

<p>
After eight years of very hard work the
farm was at last cleared.  John had worked
as hard as any man, often rising at four
o'clock in the morning and toiling till late at
night.  He made the rash vow that he would
do a man's work, and even when he was not
well, he made good his pledge.  Then, when at
last the land was cleared, his father bought a
half section of wild land four or five miles
away, and the task of clearing, breaking up,
and fencing began all over again.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the entire family moved to the
new farm, which was known as Hickory Hill
Farm.  It was high and dry, and very good
land, but there was no living water, and so a
well, ninety feet deep, had to be dug.  With
the exception of the first ten feet of ground,
was hard, fine-grained sandstone.  Mr. Muir
tried to blast the sandstone, but failed, and he
decided to have John do all the work with
mason's chisels.  This was a long, hard job,
with a good deal of danger in it.  He had to
sit cramped in a place about three feet in
diameter, and chip, chip away, day after day,
for months.  In the morning Mr. Muir and
David lowered John in a windlass, then went
away to the farm work and returned at noon
to haul him up for dinner.  After dinner he
was promptly lowered again and left there
until evening.
</p>

<p>
One day he was almost suffocated by carbonic
acid gas which had settled at the bottom
during the night.  He was almost overcome as
soon as he had been let down, but managed to
shout, "Take me out".  He was hauled up
almost more dead than alive.  Water was thrown
down to absorb the gas, and a bundle of hay
attached to a light rope was dropped and used
to carry down pure air to stir up the poison.
At last water was secured and two iron-bound
buckets swung, which drew water from the
well for many a long year.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate for John that he had made
good progress at school before he left
Scotland, for he had few opportunities to study
after he arrived on the backwoods farm.
</p>

<p>
For many years nearly every waking moment
was spent in doing some kind of manual
work.  However, he was hungry for knowledge,
and eagerly read the few books which
came his way.  Among these were the Bible,
parts of Shakespeare's poems, and selections
from Milton, Cowper and others, not often
read by boys of his age.
</p>

<p>
When he was twenty-three he decided to
attend the State University.  His father told
him that he would have to support himself by
his own efforts.  This he did, first by living
very simply, and then by seizing every
opportunity to earn a dollar.  He taught school
and worked in the harvest fields during the
long summer vacations.  When in college he
lived so frugally that sometimes he did not
spend more than half a dollar a week.
</p>

<p>
The greatest interest of John Muir's life
had always been the things he found in nature.
From the days when, as a little fellow, he
played around the fields and streams near
Dunbar in Scotland, he had loved the open air
and the hundreds of things which lived and
grew there.  When he did finish his course
at college he suffered from eye trouble, and
was even threatened with blindness.  He there
and then decided to live in the open and see as
much of the world as possible.
</p>

<p>
He set out on a walking tour through
several States.  He visited Cuba, then the
Isthmus of Panama, and then went straight to
San Francisco, where he arrived with less than
a dollar in his pocket.  This distance was all
covered on foot.  He slept in the open most of
the time and gathered biological specimens as
he went.  Sometimes he ran completely out of
money, and when this happened he secured
work until he had sufficient to proceed.
</p>

<p>
Soon after he arrived in San Francisco he
visited the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and
from then until the time of his death he found
these great hills a source of never-ending joy.
He tramped among them until he knew them
thoroughly.  It was chiefly through his efforts
that Congress set aside Yosemite as a national
park.  He was often called "Father of the Yosemite."
</p>

<p>
In 1876 he was appointed a member of the
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,
and he saw Alaska, where he travelled hundreds
of miles alone.  Later he visited Siberia,
Norway, and Switzerland.  He did not hurry
through those lands as many tourists do, but
wherever he went he studied, with much care,
the flowers and the animals that lived in the
great open spaces.  Things which others
passed with only a glance he closely observed.
His passion to study these things led him to
visit India, Russia, Australia, New Zealand,
Brazil and many other countries.  He travelled
thousands of miles on foot and generally slept
in camps and tents.
</p>

<p>
He wrote several books and a great many
articles which appeared in the big magazines.
He wrote about animals, insects, and flowers,
and his information was gained at first hand.
He knew these things because he lived among
them and loved them.  His knowledge was
recognized and appreciated.  Harvard and
several other universities conferred honourary
degrees upon him, but he cared little for these
things.  From his travels abroad he returned
to the Sierra Mountains which he loved so
passionately.  Several universities invited him
to become professor, but he preferred to live
his simple life among the mountains.  After
his death, in 1914, these beautiful lines were
written about him by Odell Shepard:

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
A SICK MAN WHO NEVER GAVE UP.
</h3>

<p>
Francis Parkman was born at
Boston on September 16, 1823.  He had
a fairly good start in life.  He lived in
a fine large brick house of three stories, with
good big lawns and lots of room, so that any
boy could have a real good time.  There were
flowers and fruit trees in abundance, and no
doubt young Francis thought himself a very
lucky boy.
</p>

<p>
When he was eight years of age he went to
live on a farm with his grandfather, and
remained there for nearly five years.  It was
during this time that he began to take a keen
interest in nature.  When not at school he
spent most of his time collecting eggs, insects,
reptiles, trapping squirrels, woodchucks, and
other animals.  All his life he was greatly
interested in animals, and many good stories are
told about him.  Once when he was sitting at
his desk in school a snake which had revived in
the warmth of the schoolroom stuck its head
out of his pocket, much to the consternation
and alarm of some pupils sitting near.
</p>

<p>
His father was a minister, and one Sunday
morning while Rev. Dr. Parkman and his wife
were walking solemnly down the street to
church with Francis close behind, Mrs. Parkman
noticed a smile on the faces of those they
passed.  She turned around to see what was
the matter, and there was Francis carrying by
the tail, at arm's length, a dead rat.  His
father made him throw away the rat and walk
with more dignity.
</p>

<p>
His favourite subject at school was history.
He was especially interested in reading about
Indians.  By the time he was seventeen he
made up his mind to write a history of the
Indian wars, and this resolution became the
controlling power of his life.  From that time
on he never lost an opportunity of studying
Indian life.  Nearly all his vacations were
spent either with Indian tribes or in carefully
going over ground which had been the scenes
of many fierce conflicts.
</p>

<p>
About this time Francis Parkman began to
have trouble both with his eyes and his heart.
He consulted several doctors and travelled
extensively, seeking to improve his health.  For
this reason, and also in order to better
acquaint himself with the manners and customs
of Indians, he joined a band of Indians on
their way to the remote West.  During this
extensive trip he suffered great pain, yet he
knew that it would be unwise to complain or
show signs of weakness.  Day after day he
faced the hardships of a strange life, riding
daily on horseback over a wild country, and
taking his share with the Indians in hunting
buffalo.
</p>

<p>
Instead of improving his health this trip
greatly weakened him, and probably did him
permanent injury.  He could not digest the
food that was given him; he became so faint
and dizzy that he had to be helped into the
saddle, and at times his mind lost its clearness.
He could not sleep at nights, and from that
time until his death he rarely, if ever, enjoyed
a good night's sleep.  When he got three
hours' sleep out of twenty-four he thought
himself lucky.  Most of the time he got even
less than this.  He was attacked with rheumatic
gout, which particularly affected one of his
knees.  This caused him intense suffering, and
for many years he could only hobble around
with the aid of a stick.
</p>

<p>
Francis Parkman, while still in his early
twenties, was a sick man.  He had so many
disorders that he was never free from pain.
Often the pain was so intense that he could not
concentrate on any subject.  He used to refer
to his many troubles as "the enemy", and this
can be said to his credit, that he never ceased
to fight "the enemy".  He had amazing
courage; probably not one man in ten thousand
could have been so brave and cheerful with so
much physical pain.
</p>

<p>
He felt his misfortunes all the more because
he so much admired strong men.  As a boy,
one of the great ambitions of his life had been
to become strong physically.  One thing which
he so much admired about the Indians was
their great agility and endurance.  And so
very early in life, he began to avoid habits
which would undermine his strength.  For
such a man, admiring the physically strong as
he did, it became a terrible trial for him to
have to go through life as an invalid.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1848 he began to write the
"History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac."  He
did this partly because he felt that to have a
strong purpose, and to keep his mind occupied,
would help him partly to forget his troubles.
In view of his condition it was a great task to
attempt.  His eyes were so extremely weak
that he could not write his own name except
by closing them.  His brain would not permit
him to work for more than a few minutes at a
time.  Every effort he made cost him a good
deal of pain.  He caused a wooden frame to be
constructed of the same size and shape as a
sheet of paper.  Stout wires were fixed
horizontally across it, half an inch apart, and
a movable back of thick pasteboard fitted
behind them.  The paper for writing was placed
between the pasteboard and the wires, guided
by which, and using a black lead crayon, he
could write fairly well with closed eyes.
</p>

<p>
He made notes for his book with eyes
closed, and these were afterwards read to him
until they had become thoroughly fixed in his
memory.  But under such terrible handicaps
did he work, that for a year and a half he only
averaged six lines of writing each day.
</p>

<p>
The fact that he could not use his eyes in
writing made his work very slow indeed.  He
had to depend upon the eyes of others.  Often
he would go to a public library with some
educated person and for hours listen to passages
from books which were likely to help him.  If
he had been well he could have seen at a
glance what books were worth spending his
time over.  As it was he had to listen to a
great many unimportant and tedious details.
</p>

<p>
Even when he was fairly well his condition
was such that he could not listen to any person
reading for more than an hour or two each
day and that with frequent intervals of rest.
It was all painfully slow and tedious work
and it is not hard to believe what he wrote in
the following words: "Taking the last forty
years as a whole, the capacity for literary
work which during that time has fallen to my
share has, I am confident, been considerably
less than a fourth part of what it would have
been under normal conditions."
</p>

<p>
In 1851 Francis Parkman published "The
Conspiracy of Pontiac" in two volumes.
Fourteen years later he published "The
Pioneers of France in the New World".  Then
followed, "The Jesuits in North America",
"LaSalle and the Discovery of the Great
West", "The Old Regime", "Count Frontenac
and New France under Louis XIV",
"Montcalm and Wolfe" and "A Half Century of
Conflict".
</p>

<p>
All those books were marked by the author's
extraordinary accuracy.  One could have
forgiven a man who was in such great pain if he
had shown signs of carelessness, yet a lack of
thoroughness was the one thing which annoyed
Francis Parkman.  He expected other people
to be thorough and painstaking in their work,
and he carried it out in his own life.  If there
was the least doubt about any statement he
would not rest until he had looked carefully
into the matter.  As a result his books
probably rank as the most reliable authorities on
Indian life, customs and history.  The
thoroughness and accuracy of his books is admitted
by all.  During the period 1848 to 1867 he
never knew a day when his body was not
racked with pain, and yet the books he wrote
during these years of severe suffering are
a model of first-class workmanship.
</p>

<p>
Many great universities hastened to honour
the scholar who had worked under such great
difficulties.  In 1879 McGill University
conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws
and Languages, and Harvard University
honoured him with the same degree in 1889.
He was made an honourary member of over
twenty scientific societies in Great Britain and
America.  He died in 1893 at the age of
seventy.  Thus came to an end the life of one
who, in spite of terrible handicaps, became
one of the greatest historians of his age.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
HOW A POOR BOY BECAME A GREAT SCIENTIST.
</h3>

<p>
Just a few days before Christmas, in 1823,
a little boy was born in the French village
of Saint Leons.  His parents were very
poor, and the young boy, whose name was Jean
Henri Fabre, was sent to live with his
grandparents, who tilled a small farm some miles
away.  There he lived until he was seven, and
made friends with the calves, the sheep, the
geese and the hens, who were almost his sole
companions.
</p>

<p>
His grandparents had no education.  They
had never opened a book in their lives.  They
had lived all their lives in that lonely
farmhouse, and they knew little, and cared less,
about the outside world.  The grandfather was
a stern old man, with his serious face, and
unclipped hair, which he generally brought
behind his ears with a flick of his thumb.  He
wore curious breeches, buckled at the knees,
and heavy wooden shoes stuffed with straw.
Young Henri was devoted to his old
grandmother, who, while she could not read, told the
little fellow many a thrilling story.
</p>

<p>
When meal time came all the members of
the family, big and little, sat round the table,
which consisted of long planks laid over two
benches.  At one end of the table would be a
huge loaf of rye bread, which only the
grandfather was allowed to cut.  The grandmother
generally attended to the bacon and turnips,
which formed the staple food.  Sometimes, on
special occasions, there would be a good supply
of homemade cheese.  There were no proper
beds in the little home, but as Henri was the
youngest, he was given a sack, stuffed with
oat-chaff, upon which to sleep.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the poverty of his surroundings,
Henri was not unhappy.  He was too young to
worry much about his appearance.  It is true
that his clothes were rough and shabby.  He
generally wore a rough frieze frock which
flapped against his bare legs, but his hardships
were forgotten in his great love for the
animals around that little farm.  He loved the
flowers, but even more he loved the living
things all around him.  Butterflies, grasshoppers,
bees, spiders, wasps, in fact, every living
thing the boy watched, and, when in the evening
the family sat around the rough table to
eat, Henri told them of his love for all these
creatures.  The other members of the family
just laughed at Henri.  How little they thought
that some day Henri would know more about
these insects than any one else in the world.
When he was seven the time came for him
to go to school, so he returned to his father's
house in Saint Leons.  The school he attended,
which was the schoolmaster's home, consisted
of one room, which had to serve as school,
kitchen, bedroom, dining-room, and,
sometimes, chicken-house and piggery.  The
schoolmaster himself was not a man of much
learning, and seemed more interested in his chickens
and pigs than in anything else, but he managed
to teach the pupils their letters and some
elementary subjects.  Often in the middle of a
lesson the door would be burst open, and a
dozen hungry little pigs would scamper in,
followed by a brood of chickens.  By the time
they had been put out the schoolmaster would
have considerable difficulty in getting his
scholars' attention back to the lesson.  It was
a noisy school indeed.  All the boys loved the
arithmetic lesson because it gave them a
chance to shout.  The whole class would recite
the multiplication table in unison, and they
would simply yell until even the little pigs
became scared, and bolted out of the school.
</p>

<p>
Just about this time something happened
which had a great influence over Henri Fabre.
As a reward for doing well at school he was
given a prize&mdash;a book about animals, with
scores of pictures in it.  True, it was only a
cheap edition, with paper covers, but to Henri
it seemed priceless.  How he pored over its
contents, and looked at the pictures of coons,
foxes, wolves, dogs, cats, asses, rabbits, and
dozens of other animals!  This served to
kindle his love for living things, and when the
schoolmaster told the boys to go into his
garden and kill the insects Henri crammed
them into his pockets.  Snails, beetles, and
even wasps, all seemed to him too interesting
to be ruthlessly killed.
</p>

<p>
When Henri was ten his parents moved
from Saint Leons to the town of Rodez.  There
he attended a school where he was granted free
tuition for rendering certain services in the
chapel.  Attired in a surplice, red skull-cap,
and cassock, he, together with three other boys,
performed his services in the chapel, and
received instruction of a much more advanced
character than he had yet received.  Some of
the studies he found difficult, and if he had
listened to the call of the woods, he would often
have played truant, for he was much more
interested in the living things he found there
than in the dry subjects learned in the school.
But he remembered his poor parents at home,
and their anxiety to see him make progress,
so he stuck to even the most difficult tasks, and
his record there was a good one.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this misfortune visited his
family, and Henri had to leave school, and
for some considerable time he suffered many
hardships.  He often went without food, and
wandered along the highroads, selling lemons
at country fairs, and later working at the
building of a railway.  Just at that time he
was fortunate in winning a bursary for the
normal school at Avignon, and so ended a
period of his life which had been exceedingly
dark.
</p>

<p>
During the years he spent at Avignon he
pursued his studies with earnest purpose, and
acquitted himself with distinction.  He gained
his college diploma, and was appointed to
teach in a school at Carpentras, and after
some years of close study he was made
Professor of Physics and Chemistry at Ajaccio.
</p>

<p>
During these years Henri Fabre's interest
in insects had been steadily increasing.  Little
creatures that other people thought ugly, he
studied and loved.  One day a naturalist, who
had been attracted to Fabre, was explaining
some things to him of unusual interest.
Suddenly the naturalist took a pair of scissors
and burst open a shell, and then explained to
Fabre the anatomy of a snail.  That incident
opened a new world for Fabre.  His interest
in insects, which had always been great,
became extraordinary.  No longer was he
content to study the outward form of insects, but
he dissected and thoroughly examined all that
came within his range.  Often late at night, or
again early in the morning, when other people
were in their beds, he searched the country
lanes and pools for specimens of insects, and
then studied them closely to find out their
habits of life.
</p>

<p>
Soon Henri Fabre became recognized as one
who understood insect life as well, if not better,
than any other living person.  This is not to
be wondered at, for an insect, which to other
people, meant nothing, was a subject of great
interest to him.  If he were walking along the
highway and an insect appeared, he would
leave another man to follow it and study its
movements, and he was quite indifferent as to
what people thought of him.  One day, when
in his home, an unusually interesting wasp
appeared; he dropped what he was doing and
watched its movements for hours, utterly
forgetting everything else.
</p>

<p>
Although so well known and respected as a
great scientist, Henri Fabre was still poor.
His income did not amount to much more than
three hundred dollars a year.  Then he was
made a member of the Legion of Honour, one
of the greatest distinctions which could be
awarded to any man.  He was introduced to
the Emperor of France, and soon the French
people everywhere began to look upon him
with great pride.  In spite of his great fame,
he was a comparatively poor man, but his
habits of life were simple, and he did not long
for fame.  Life was supremely happy when left
alone to study the tiny creatures of the insect
world.
</p>

<p>
In 1879, Fabre retired from the college at
Avignon to Serignan.  There, more than ever,
he had time to follow the bent of his life, and
then he began to publish his famous books
about insects, which are so fascinating.  One
after another, his books were printed, and all
over the world people began to look upon these
books as works of authority.  He wrote: "The
Life of the Spider", "The Life of the Fly",
"The Life of the Caterpillar", "The Life of
the Grasshopper", "The Life of the Weevil",
"The Glow-worm and other Beetles", and a
great many other books upon subjects of which
very few people knew much.
</p>

<p>
The methods of his research were very
simple&mdash;a magnifying-glass, two scalpels,
made by himself from needles, a saucer for his
dissecting trough, empty match-boxes and
sardine tins for his specimen cases, a few wires
under which he could imprison insects and
watch them&mdash;these were about the only things
he needed.  He had extraordinary patience,
and he loved with great tenderness the
creatures whose habits he studied.
</p>

<p>
Fabre lived to be ninety-two years of age.
He died in 1915, while the Great War was
raging.  Before his death his real genius was
recognized all over the world.  The foremost
scientific societies of England, Sweden,
Belgium, Russia and other lands hastened to
confer honourary titles upon him, and while he
himself was so simple and modest that he
cared little for fame, the honours conferred
showed how highly he was esteemed.  From
being a very poor boy, Henri Fabre became
one of the greatest scientists that ever lived.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
WHAT AN ILLITERATE BOY MADE OF HIS LIFE.
</h3>

<p>
Just seven days before Christmas, 1851, a
baby was born at Mansfield, Nottingham,
England, named James Flanaghan, who
was destined to have a pretty hard time of it
for several years.  The baby's father was
Patrick Flanaghan, and, as his name would
suggest, was Irish by nationality.  When he
was sober, Patrick Flanaghan was a good
husband and father, but when he was drunk&mdash;which
was pretty often&mdash;he acted like a beast.
At the sound of his unsteady step on the stairs,
his wife and children prepared for the worst.
Often what little furniture there was in the
Flanaghan home would be smashed to atoms
in the fury of the man's drunken passion, and
the mother and children would be driven out
into the street, to wander around until some
one had pity on them and took them in.
</p>

<p>
After a few years James went to work with
his father at the task of pipe-making in a
factory.  His father was the kiln man, and was
clever in the art of giving fixity to moulds of
clay by a process of burning.  James stood at
the table modelling clay into tobacco pipes.
It was hard work for the boy, and all he
received was sixty cents a week.  The father
became dissatisfied with such small wages, and
so James was taken out of the factory to work
in a coal mine.
</p>

<p>
A lady, in whose class James sat at Sunday
school, gave him a coat which was several
sizes too large for him.  His mother wept when
she saw him; he looked so funny; but James
was too young to worry over his appearance,
and he was glad to have a coat to keep him
warm.
</p>

<p>
The men with whom James worked down
the mine, teased him or cursed him, according
to their moods.  They were rough men and
often their language was vile.  At meal times
James munched his crust of bread and cheese,
and heard tales which had been told in the
saloon the night before.
</p>

<p>
Soon he was taken, along with other lads
of his age, to the saloon.  His sweet singing
astonished and pleased the drunken men there.
He sang songs which he had heard, and he
attended theatres, and such was his memory that
he could reproduce whole scenes that he had
witnessed.  For all this James received a good
deal of praise, and especially from the
saloon-keepers, who were glad to have any one who
could attract men to their drinking places.
</p>

<p>
Through the influence of a Sunday-school
worker, named Parker, James was induced to
attend a religious service at a Methodist
church.  He sat very reverently through the
service although it all seemed very strange to
him, and much of it he did not understand.
When at the close of the service a man took
him by the hand and said: "God bless you, my
brother," he was deeply touched, and his eyes
filled up with tears.  He was not accustomed
to that kind of speech.  It was the kindness of
the people which led him back to that church
again.  Deep impressions for good were made
on the young lad's mind, although he could
not make up his mind what to do.  He had a
great many evil companions, and he knew it
would be a difficult thing for him to break
away from them; however, one Sunday morning
as he sat in church, listening to an earnest
sermon, he bowed his head, and gave himself
to God.  It was the turning-point in James
Flanaghan's life.
</p>

<p>
He was at this time about sixteen years of
age, but he had practically no education.  He
could not write his own name, nor even
distinguish the letters of the alphabet.  He had
never been to school one day in his life, and
practically all he knew was the vulgar
sayings he had heard in the mine, and in the
saloons.  But he began to improve himself at
once, and, big fellow though he was, he bought
an alphabet and learned his letters thoroughly,
and then he began the simplest kind of
reading.  Often when he came home from the mine,
tired though he was, he sat up until past
midnight trying to make up for lost years.
</p>

<p>
He tried hard and made good progress.
As soon as he was able to read well enough to
spell out the words, he committed to memory
the One Hundred and Third Psalm.  It took
him quite a while to learn it all for he could
only commit to memory a few verses at a time,
but he succeeded, and this fine psalm filled his
mind with beautiful thoughts during the hours
he spent down the mine.  Then soon afterwards
when there was need for teachers in the
Sunday School he offered his services.  He
was given the beginners' class at first, for he
could neither read nor teach the lessons for
older scholars, but as he advanced in knowledge
he was promoted to other classes, and
after a few years was actually made
superintendent of the school.
</p>

<p>
There was a group of earnest men in that
church, who, like Flanaghan, worked hard,
but who on Sundays preached either in
small churches and mission halls of the
district, or in the open air.  Soon he
joined them, and although his first prayers
and brief addresses in public were halting
and a source of anxiety to him, he rapidly
improved, and all the neighbouring churches
were glad to have him preach in their
pulpits.  Miners who had known him for
several years could not understand how he had
become educated so quickly.  They knew that
he had never been a day at public school in his
life and that even at sixteen he could neither
read nor write.  Yet now he could read whole
chapters of the Bible in public, and could
preach sermons that showed he had read many
other books as well.  He was still working
fourteen hours a day in the mine, and his time
for reading was strictly limited, but he never
wasted a moment, and his perseverance and
earnestness, together with his excellent
memory, soon enabled him to preach as though he
had attended school as other young men.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this he was asked to conduct
some services at a village named Long Clawson.
These services were so successful that he
was engaged to conduct further services in
that district for a period of six months.  Of
course, this meant giving up work in the coal
mine, and moving elsewhere.  The news quickly
spread throughout the little town where he
lived, and the people came to his house to wish
him and his wife and children "God speed."  His
conversion, and the marvellous progress
he had made in education were widely known,
and all were deeply interested.  He stood upon
a chair, and the crowd gathered around.  He
told them again of his conversion, and after
a few earnest words, bade them a tender
farewell.  All were deeply moved and there were
few dry eyes.
</p>

<p>
For four years James Flanaghan did the
work of an evangelist; making visits, varying
from ten days to four weeks, at many places
throughout the country.  Whenever he could
spare half an hour he spent it in reading.  He
knew that he had a great deal of ground to
make up, and he never could make it up
unless he worked hard.  His careful reading soon
showed in his sermons and addresses.  Not
only were his public speeches earnest, they
were thoughtful, and people who had known
him in other years considered his progress
nothing short of a miracle.
</p>

<p>
Then he was appointed city missionary for
the city of Nottingham.  During the time he
lived there James Flanaghan became widely
known and greatly beloved.  The services he
conducted at the large mission hall were the
most important gatherings he had ever
addressed.  The large building held two thousand
people and quite often it was filled to
overflowing.  A brotherhood organization for men
was established with over two thousand members,
and the entire city of Nottingham was
influenced for good.  When the time came for
him to leave the city, he carried away with him
the good wishes of all.
</p>

<p>
In 1891, when he was forty years of age,
James Flanaghan was made a minister of the
Primitive Methodist Church.  This was a
somewhat unusual thing to do, as he had never
been to college, nor taken any regular course
of study, but his work had shown that he was
a true and able servant of God and he would
never disgrace the ministry, for his close
study for more than twenty years had made
him a well-educated man.
</p>

<p>
His first charge after ordination was at
Trinity Street Church, London.  Here he
found a large church, almost empty, yet
surrounded by a vast population of very poor
people.  His first Sunday was not an
encouraging one.  There were only thirty-six
people at the morning service, and thirty-seven
in the evening, but James Flanaghan
had been facing difficulties all his life, and had
become used to them.  From the time when,
as a baby he had been turned out into the
streets with his poor mother, up to the time he
stood in the big empty church at London, it
had been a bitter, uphill struggle, but rough
weather makes good sailors, and Flanaghan's
heart was strong and brave.
</p>

<p>
The more he learned about the district
around his church the more he realized the
need for Christian work.  There were scores
of low-class drinking places, and the
lodging-houses were little better than haunts for
animals.  There was one lodging house where
thirteen murders had been committed, but the
very wretchedness of the district made an
appeal to Flanaghan's sympathy, and he worked
harder than he had ever worked in his life; if
that were possible.  Soon the large building
was filled.  Fine, enthusiastic meetings were
held during the week and hundreds of boys in
that neighbourhood enjoyed their first games
in the gymnasium of the church.
</p>

<p>
Soon the premises, which had seemed so
large and empty at first, were far too small to
hold all the people who were eager to attend.
What was to be done?  The people of the
district certainly could not raise money to
enlarge the premises, and so it was decided that
Mr. Flanaghan should visit towns and cities
outside of London during the week, and by
lecturing and preaching raise sufficient money
to build larger and better premises.  In less
than two years Mr. Flanaghan had raised the
sum of twenty thousand dollars, which made
it possible to begin work on the new buildings.
</p>

<p>
By this time the name of James Flanaghan
had become known throughout England.  Just
the announcement on a billboard that "James
Flanaghan is coming," was a sufficient
advertisement to fill any church or hall.  Under
the magic spell of his eloquence people became
generous in their gifts for the poor.  Poor
children brought their coppers to buy a new
brick in the buildings.  A man who was penniless
put his watch and chain on the collection
plate, while another man brought a hen and
requested that it be sold, and the funds used as
the speaker wished.
</p>

<p>
The new hall was formally opened on January
4th, 1900, and is known as St. George's
Hall.  It is a fine, well-equipped building, and
from the day it was opened until the present
time it has been a means of blessing to
thousands of people in that crowded section of
London, known as Bermondsey, where people
live under conditions which, fortunately, are
almost unknown in this land.
</p>

<p>
James Flanaghan's reputation spread
overseas, and in 1908 he was invited to tour
Australia and New Zealand.  He received a great
welcome in New Zealand by people of all
denominations.  Arrangements had been made
for large meetings, but in most cases the
churches and halls which had been engaged
were much too small.  No visitor to that land
for many years so favourably impressed the
people.  Audiences were held spellbound by
his eloquence.  How few of those who so
admired his culture and lofty thought realized
that they were listening to a man who had
never been to public school a day in his life,
and who up to the time of his sixteenth
birthday could neither read or write.  Lord
Plunkett, the Governor of New Zealand, greatly
admired Mr. Flanaghan, and showed him much
kindness.  Sir J. C. Ward, the Prime Minister,
made him an honoured guest of the Parliament,
and wherever he went his fine bearing
and culture made an excellent impression.
When he left he received the thanks of all the
Christian Churches.  A similar welcome was
extended to him in Australia, and there he was
for some time the guest of Lord Chief Justice
and Lady Way.
</p>

<p>
He returned to his work in England, and
found time to write several books, which had a
wide circulation and did much good.  Such
were the demands for his services that only a
small percentage of the requests could be
acceded to, but he led a busy life and exerted
much influence for good.
</p>

<p>
In 1914 he was taken ill, and a year later
he had to retire from active work.  This was
a great trial to one who so loved his work, but
he gradually became weaker.  He died on
March 30th, 1918, and his passing was
regretted by thousands throughout the world.
Members of the British Parliament, mayors,
aldermen and councillors of London and the
provinces joined the bereaved family in the
church and placed flowers upon his grave.  All
were glad to honour the memory of one who,
though he had started life under heavy
handicaps, had made his life one of blessing and
usefulness to a vast number of people.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
A DONKEY BOY WHO BECAME A FAMOUS SCULPTOR.
</h3>

<p>
A few miles from the city of Sheffield in
England there is a little village named
Norton.  It was on a tiny farm, near
this village, that Francis Chantrey was born
on April 7th, 1781.  He learned the alphabet
at home, and then at the age of six he went to
the village school.  The old school register is
still in existence.  It shows that he began to
read in April 1787; to write in January, 1788;
and to learn arithmetic in October, 1792.  The
register also shows that Francis often missed
school; often for weeks and months at a time.
Children were not compelled to attend school
in those days, and as his parents were poor, it
seems likely that Francis worked around the
farm, driving cattle and working hard in the
fields.
</p>

<p>
In those days the city of Sheffield was
supplied with milk from the outlying farms.  The
milk was put into barrels, and two barrels were
slung across a donkey's back, one to balance
the other.  The barrels had taps and the milk
was drawn off into tins for house-to-house
delivery.  Many of the small boys, who drove
the donkeys, became notorious for mischief.
Often a donkey would refuse to budge an inch,
and then the young driver would apply the
whip with all his might, while the ass would fix
its forelegs into the ground and throw up its
hind legs in an effort to dislodge the driver.
Very often there would be so much jumping
around that the milk must have been nearly
churned into butter.
</p>

<p>
One morning Francis Chantrey was sauntering
along with his donkey when he came across
a cat sitting on a wall.  He made friends with
pussy, and seeing a hollow place in the wall, he
poured in some milk, and watched the cat
drink.  Next morning when he came to the
same place the cat was there waiting for her
breakfast, and he was so pleased that he gave
her another supply.  That continued for a long
time.  Each morning&mdash;no matter what the
weather was&mdash;pussy was at her place by the
hollow in the wall, and Francis never failed
to pet her and leave a supply of milk.
</p>

<p>
He called his donkey "Jock", and one day
when he had delivered all his milk in the city,
he was returning with the week's supply of
groceries, when Jock stopped to drink at a pool
by the side of the road.  The donkey found the
water so cool and refreshing that before
Francis Chantrey had time to prevent him, he
slid down into the water, groceries and all.  He
was just about to roll over and over, when his
young master made him get up.  As it was, all
the tea, sugar and other groceries were soaked,
and it was a cross boy who tried to recover
what he could from the pond with a rake.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when Francis walked by the side
of Jock to and from Sheffield, he would amuse
himself by whittling a stick with his
pocket-knife.  One day he was doing this when a
gentleman met him, and examined his work,
and then asked what it was.  "It is the head of
Old Fox," said Francis, whose schoolmaster
was named Fox.  The man thought the carving
was so good that he gave Francis sixpence,
and that was the first money he ever earned by
his carving.
</p>

<p>
The boy loved drawing pictures, and as the
floor of his humble home was of stones, or
flags as they are called in English farmhouses,
he used to draw pictures upon the floor each
Saturday before his mother scrubbed the floor.
No doubt his mother often thought the drawings
were so good that it was a shame to wash
them off.
</p>

<p>
One day a gentleman came to Mr. Chantrey
to do some business, and Mrs. Chantrey
brought out a large pork pie, upon the top of
which were worked cleverly in paste, a sow
and several pigs.  When the man saw it, he
exclaimed: "What a shame that you should
have gone to the expense of getting such a pie
for me."  When Mrs. Chantrey explained that
she had made the pie herself, and Francis had
modelled the young pigs, when the dough was
soft, he was amazed at the boy's ingenuity.
</p>

<p>
Francis' father died when he was twelve
years of age, and soon after he was
apprenticed to a Mr. Robert Ramsay, who had a
small shop in Sheffield where he sold pictures,
plaster models, wood carvings, and such
things.  He was now in the midst of the things
he loved, and he took great delight in handling
pictures and plaster models.  Nothing pleased
him better than to model soft clay with his
fingers.  Sometimes a mould would be taken
of a person's face, and young Chantrey
thought that he would like to try and take a
mould of this kind.  He persuaded one of
Mr. Ramsay's workmen to lie face upwards upon a
table, and then he placed the soft plaster over
the man's face and throat, and waited for it
to harden.  Suddenly the man rolled off the
table and madly stripped away the plaster
from his throat.  Young Chantrey did not
know that a man cannot breathe unless his
throat can expand, and when this plaster
began to harden it was making it impossible for
the man to breathe.
</p>

<p>
He was so eager to gain knowledge that he
rented a cheap little room, and spent his
evenings and holidays drawing and making models.
The long hours he spent in that room he never
forgot, and in the year before he died he
visited that little room, and spoke to friends
of the many happy hours he had spent there.
</p>

<p>
When he was no longer an apprentice he
looked around for some way in which to earn
a living.  He was severely handicapped in some
ways.  When he was ten years of age his
parents made the discovery that he was quite
blind in one eye.  Up to that time no one had
ever suspected such a thing.  Then again he
had attended school very little and was not
by any means a good scholar.  The letters
which he wrote when he became a man show
that even then he was a very poor scholar.  His
writing ran on without any punctuation; many
words were wrongly spelt, and God was
written with a small "g".
</p>

<p>
Those were the days when there were no
photographers, and portrait painters could
often make a fair living.  Many artists went
from farm to farm, seeking for work to do,
and Francis Chantrey decided to do this.  In
1802 he put the following advertisement in a
Sheffield newspaper:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Francis Chantrey begs permission to
inform the ladies and gentlemen of Sheffield, and
its vicinity, that, during his stay here, he
wishes to employ his time in taking of
portraits in crayons, and miniatures, at the
pleasure of the person who shall do him the
honour to sit.  Although a young artist, he has
had the opportunity of acquiring improvement
from a strict attention to the works of
Messrs. Smith, Arnold, gentlemen of eminence.  He
trusts in being happy to produce good and
satisfactory likenesses; and no exertion shall
be wanting on his part, to render his humble
efforts deserving some small share of public
patronage.  Terms&mdash;from two to three guineas.
24 Paradise Square."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Chantrey was at this time twenty-one years
of age.  He worked hard at portrait-painting,
and although he did not earn a great deal, he
made a fair living.  He painted shopkeepers,
farmers and artisans.  He painted a portrait
of his old schoolmaster, Mr. Fox, and another
of the vicar.  The people of Norton Village
were proud of him, and anxious to see him get
a good start.  At last he moved to London, and
besides painting portraits he secured a
position as a woodcarver's assistant.  His total
earnings were five shillings a day.  For some
time he had a very hard struggle.  He was
quite unknown and poor.  It was only by
taking care of every penny that he managed to
live at all.  In many ways these days were the
hardest he had ever known, for he was all
alone in London, and had to make his own
way.  He worked away at carving in a garret,
and could only afford one candle, which he
used to wear in his cap so that the light might
move with him as he changed positions.
</p>

<p>
At this time the president of the Academy
was the great painter, Benjamin West.
Chantrey thought that if West would allow
him to make a bust of him, it would do much
to bring his work before the public, so he
asked West to sit for a portrait in plaster.
West was an unusually kind, but at the same
time, a very busy man.  He was at that time
painting a great picture: "Christ Healing the
Sick."  He told Chantrey that if he were
willing to catch his likeness as he worked away
at his picture, he was welcome to try.  Chantrey
was pleased with the offer and for many
days he sat and moulded the plaster, as West
worked at his task.  The bust Chantrey did at
this time can now be seen at the Royal
Academy in London.  Soon afterwards he
made a bust of Mr. Samuel Shore, for which
he received one hundred guineas; by far the
largest sum he had ever been paid.  He gave up
painting altogether, for he was now fairly well
established as a sculptor.
</p>

<p>
At that time there was living in London a
very brilliant man, named Horn Tooke.
Chantrey made a bust in plaster of this man
and sent it to the exhibition.  It looked at first
as though there would not be a place for it
there, but another sculptor, Mr. Joseph
Nollekens, saw it and was much impressed.
He was not jealous, but said: "This is a fine, a
very fine bust; let the man who made it be
known.  Remove one of my busts and put it
in its place, for it well deserves it."  This was
a great thing for Chantrey, for this bust
aroused a great deal of interest, and he soon
received commissions to do work which
brought him more than twelve thousand
pounds.
</p>

<p>
Very soon after this something happened
which helped to bring Francis Chantrey more
to the front than ever and to establish him as
"The Prince of British Sculptors".  In 1811
it was decided to erect a statue of King George
III.  Naturally there was a great deal of
excitement among sculptors; all were anxious to
receive the honour of doing it.  A committee
was formed to choose a sculptor.  Fifteen of
the greatest sculptors submitted designs to the
committee, and the members decided that
Chantrey's was the best, and so he was given
the important task of doing it.
</p>

<p>
As soon as it was known that the commission
had been given to Francis Chantrey, he had
the news conveyed to his mother.  He knew
that it would give her great pleasure; and
indeed it did, for she burst into tears.  It seemed
to her marvellous that her boy, who only a few
years before had drawn pictures on the kitchen
floor, should be chosen to design a statue of
the king.  There was great stir and excitement
in the village of Norton.  The wonderful tidings
spread from cottage to cottage.  "Francis
Chantrey has been chosen to make the king's
statue," was the news that everybody was repeating.
</p>

<p>
After making a statue of the king, of course,
Chantrey was considered capable of making a
design for any one, as indeed he was.  The rich
and famous crowded to his studio in order
to get busts made of themselves.  It would be
impossible to put here a complete list of all for
whom he made designs, but among other
well-known people there were: Sir Walter Scott,
Bishop Heber, who wrote "From Greenland's
Icy Mountains" and other fine hymns; James
Watt, the inventor, and many others.
</p>

<p>
Some years later, when William IV was
king, Francis Chantrey was knighted, and so
became Sir Francis Chantrey.  After that
brief reign came to an end, and George IV
came to the throne, the monarch became a
great admirer of Chantrey, and was so well
pleased with the statue of himself, which the
sculptor made, that he insisted on paying much
more than had been agreed upon.  This very
fine statue now stands in Trafalgar Square,
London, and for it Chantrey received the sum
of nine thousand guineas.  Magnificent statues
done by Francis Chantrey may now be seen in
many lands.  In Ireland, Scotland, India,
United States, and other lands his work is
seen and appreciated.
</p>

<p>
His deep affection for his mother was shown
in many ways.  He loved to have her visit him
at his home in London, and though she had
been a humble, hard-working woman all her
life, he was always proud to make her known
to his friends.  When, on one occasion he was
very ill, he would not allow any one to acquaint
his mother lest she should worry.  The letters
he wrote to his mother were full of tenderness
and scarcely a week passed in which he did not
send her some present.
</p>

<p>
He was modest to an extraordinary degree.
Many men who have risen from lowly
circumstances have become spoiled by success and
made vain.  Such was not the case with
Francis Chantrey.  He became the friend of
great men and of kings, but he loved to talk of
his humble origin, and fame never made him,
in the least degree, vain.
</p>

<p>
Standing in the most crowded thoroughfare
of London, England; in that square which has
the Bank of England on the north, the Royal
Exchange upon the east, the Mansion House
on the south, with Cheapside running west,
there stands a magnificent statue of the Duke
of Wellington on horseback.  Thousands have
gazed upon that noble monument, and admired
it.  It is the work of Francis Chantrey.
No doubt many who see it will think of a lonely
little farmhouse, one hundred and fifty miles
away, where he first saw the light, and they
will remember the donkey boy who became the
greatest of British sculptors.

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
